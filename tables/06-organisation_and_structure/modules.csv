Module,Description,Relevant Variables
"**TRC**: Tracers, Suspended Soilds and Retention Time","Modellers can use the aed_tracer to simulate a dissolved or particulate tracer (subject to transport processes only), or this can be optionally configured to account for decay, sedimentation and/or resuspension. This module also include an option to simulate water “retention time” where the water age increments once enters into the waterbody",T
**OXY**: Dissolved Oxygen,"Dissolved oxygen (DO) dynamics are able to be simulated, accounting for atmospheric exchange and sediment oxygen demand, and through links to other modules will account for microbial use during organic matter mineralisation and nitrification, photosynthetic oxygen production and respiratory oxygen consumption, and respiration by other optional biotic components",O~2~
**NUT**: Inorganic Nutrients,"Modules exist for simulation of inorganic nutrients including phosphorus, nitrogen and silica. These modules provide basic nutrient cycling functionality and are designed to be linked with other modules (eg OGM, PHY) in order to provide a more comprehensive depiction of nutrient cycling.",
**OGM**: Organic Matter,"Organic matter variables cover the C, N & P stored in the dissolved and particulate organic matter pools. This module optionally also supports depiction of “labile” vs “refractory” fractions of organic matter, including the breakdown and hydrolysis process, photo-degradation and mineralisation.",
**PHY**: Phytoplankton,"Highly customisable phytoplankton module for simulating change in algae, cyano-bacteria and chl-a, including phytoplankton production/respiration, nutrient uptake, excretion, vertical movement (eg buoyancy control), and grazing effects. Benthic phytoplankton may also be optionally configured.",
**ZOO**: Zooplankton,"Simulates different size classes of zooplankton, accounting for carbon and nutrient assimilation from grazing, carbon loss via respiration, excretion of DOM, faecal pellet production, mortality, and predation by larger organisms.",
**TOT**: Totals,"A summary module, allowing users to “sum-up” component variables from other modules into a total, for example, to compute TN, TP or TSS.",
**SDF**: Sediment Flux,"An interface module designed to provide spatially variable sediment flux settings to key modules (e.g., OXY, OGM, NUT), and/or link these variables to the dynamic sediment biogeochemistry model (SDG).",
