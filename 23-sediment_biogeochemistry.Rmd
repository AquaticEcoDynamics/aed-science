## Overview

This module is a sediment reactive transport model, based on a 1D approximation of the sediment and pore-water profiles. Each active sediment zone (or column) is discretized into a user defineable number of layers that start at thicknesses of around 1mm at the sediment-water interface and increase exponentially down to a pre-defined sediment depth. The model resolves in each layer both physical (e.g. pore-water diffusion or bioturbation) and chemical (e.g., redox transformations) processes.

Under some conditions, the sediment stores can release nutrients to the water column, while under other conditions, the sediment can remove nutrients over the long-term through burial, and the surface layers can remove nitrogen through processes like denitrification. The fine balance that controls the conditions under which the sediment will store, release or remove nutrients is largely governed by the aerobic state of the sediment pore water, and the amount of reactive organic matter fuelling the reactions. The depth-resolved sediment model accounts for mixing from the hydrodynamic model into the upper sediment layers and then calculates whether organic matter is consumed aerobically, through denitrification or deeper down, through sulfate reduction or even methanogenesis.

Sediment early-diagenesis models are highly complex environmental reactive transport simulation tools. The meta-analysis by Paraska et al. (2014) discussed the history of their evolution to these complex configurations, in which the original models of Boudreau (1996), Van Cappellen and Wang (1996) and Soetaert et al. (1996) were taken up and applied in many contexts by new modellers, who added new features and extended their capabilities, or discarded old features as required. The meta-analysis also identified the major challenges associated with developing new sediment diagenesis models. Here, the AED modelling package for sediment biogeochemistry is presented, CANDI-AED, which is an extension of the Approach 1 models, but reengineered and augmented with new model approaches and capabilities as a way to address some of these challenges. 

Paraska et al. (2015) outlined the significance and uncertainty associated with different parameterisation approaches of organic matter dynamics. In these cases, simulations were run to test the significance of different theoretical approaches and model structural assumptions, using an idealised model setup with only primary oxidation reactions and no physical processes or spatial resolution. The true impact of these different model approaches within a spatially-resolved model, accounting for all of the advection, diffusion and secondary reaction processes, however, is yet to be determined and it is unclear whether some formulations may suit some application contexts better than others. Therefore there is a need for a fully flexible model structure that can include these different organic matter breakdown parameterisations and allow users to assess critically the alternative approaches. In addition, other aspects related to secondary redox reactions, mineral reactions, precipitation and adsorption should similarly be subject to comparative assessments.

The model included in AED aimed to address challenges of building a generic and full-featured, open-source model code with the flexibility to do the following:

-	set different kinetic rate equation approaches
-	set different organic matter pools and breakdown processes
-	use standard inhibition or thermodynamic limits on primary oxidation
- optionally use manganese, iron and iron sulphide reactions
-	simulate adsorbed metals and nutrients
-	simulate calcium, iron and manganese carbonates
-	connect the boundary to either another model, a programmed file or a fixed concentration

Therefore the numerical model presented in this module has many optional features and alternative parameterisations for key processes, without mandating their inclusion in the calculations or enforcing a fixed model structure.

The sediment model CANDI-AED presented here is implemented as an optionally configurable module in the AED model library. Through the model coupling approach it may be applied with any of the hydrodynamic models linked to AED, or alternatively, options to run in isolation are also possible. This chapter provides a scientific description of the model and describes attributes of the model associated with its practical implementation and operation. 
<!-- An case-study of the model framework is also demonstrated.  -->


## Model Description

The heart of this model is the reaction, diffusion, advection model of Berner (1980), which was implemented as the Carbon and Nutrient Diagenesis model of Boudreau (1996), later further developed as the C.CANDI code (Luff et al. 2000). The CANDI-AED implementation however has evolved from the original code, and including extensions related to the treatment of organic matter, the simulation of the geochemical conditions known to influence the diagenetic equations, extensions for nutrients and trace metals, and dynamics at the sediment-water interface (SWI). However, the core organic matter breakdown equations (and their numerical solution) remains similar as the original descriptions presented in Boudreau (1996), and to other similar sediment models. An overview of the model is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:23-pic2).

```
</center>

<br>

In addition to physical processes, the CANDI-AED model considers two types of chemical reactions - the slow, kinetically controlled reactions, and the fast thermodynamically based equilibrium reactions. The latter are simulated in the sediment through appropriate configuration of the geochemistry reactions; the configuration of the equilibrium model will apply to both the water and each of the sediment layers. The kinetically controlled reactions are mostly microbially-mediated and include the reactions for organic matter breakdown and eventual oxidation, the re-oxidation of various by-products and the dynamics of the metal sulfides. These are outlined in further detail in the next sections.

###	Process Descriptions

#### Primary Redox Reactions {-}

The key chemical process that causes ongoing change in the sediment is the breakdown of organic matter. The user can decide how complex or simple the organic matter breakdown pathway should be, with three options of varying complexity for parameterising the pathways included (Figure x). The first option (`OMModel = 1`) is a common multi-G model in which the POM phases are decomposed straight to CO~2~ and other breakdown products. Here POM is a variable that is not precisely defined, and its components (such as C, N and P) must be determined in post-processing based on a user-defined fixed stoichiometry. The second option (`OMModel = 2`) is another 2G model with both particulate and dissolved organic matter (POM and DOM) phases included and parameterisation hydrolysis of POM to DOM, and then DOM to CO~2~ and other breakdown products. The POM and DOM phases consist of three variables each, which trace the reaction and transport of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus, thereby allowing for variable stoichiometry of organic matter to occur temporally and spatially. The third option (`OMModel = 3`) has many POM phases, which are all hydrolysed to DOM, which then undergoes fermentation and terminal metabolism, as using the mechanistic approach from Chapter 3.  This allows the carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus to be calculated precisely before and after a model run, and allows the free energies of the reaction of each phase to be included. This third option is the most detailed and mechanistic, and allows for expansion of more detailed reaction mechanisms to be included.

The terminal redox reaction pathways are the six pathways that are available in most diagenesis models, and are driven by different organic matter pools, depending on the OMModel configuration chosen from the above options (Table x). AED CANDI allows the use of Approach 1 or 2 organic matter oxidation rate equations, as examined in detail in Paraska et al (2015).

The decay of the complex $OM$ types to the LMW $DOM$ required for the hetertrophic bacteria to utilise are all modelled with a simple first-order decay rate. The subsequent reactions for terminal metabolism that describe the breakdown of $OM$ may be written as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\overbrace{(CH_2O)_{106}(NH_3)_{16}(H_3PO_4)}^{\textrm{organic matter}} &+& 138O_2 \rightarrow \nonumber
\\
&& 106CO_2 + 16HNO_3 + H_3PO_4 + 122H_2O

\end{eqnarray}

and the reaction rates for each of these are calculated dynamically based on Monod expressions which mediate the reaction rate according to the concentration of potential oxidants higher in the redox sequence, and the concentration of the available oxidant.

The rate equation for the oxidation of the oxidants with any of the pools above can include any of the terms in equation x, where $R_{{Ox}_i}$ is the reaction of an oxidant $i$ (Arndt et al. 2013) (Table x). The kinetic rate constant $k_{OM}$ gives the maximum oxidation rate, which is different for each reactive type, but the same for each oxidation pathway. Alternatively, using OMModel 3, the kinetic rate constant is the rate of bacterial growth.

The factor for terminal electron acceptor (TEA) limitation is FTEA (x), where options for Approach 1 or Approach 2 equations are available. The Monod constant for rate limitation at low oxidant concentration is $K_{TEA}$ in Approach 1 and LTEA in Approach 2. Similarly, the inhibition term $F_{In}$ (x) can be set to Approach 1 or 2 equations, or turned off entirely. The constant for inhibition until low oxidant concentrations is $K_{In}$ for Approach 1 and $L_{IN}$ for Approach 2. 

$F_{T}$ is a thermodynamic factor. The current version of the model includes FT only for OMModel 3, for terminal oxidation reactions and fermentation. 

$F_{OM}$ is the organic matter concentration and may be a Monod function as in equation x ($K_{OM}$ is a half saturation constant and the index $i$ is the reactive phase). Using OMModels 1 and 2, $F_{OM}$ is the concentration of the substrate, rather than a Monod function. The current version of the model has switches built in for both the temperature dependence factor, $F_{Tem}$, where values of 1 or 2 turn them off and on. However, implementation and testing of the factors has not been carried out for this version of the model. The metabolism rate at $T_{0}$ is $R_{0}$, $ξ$ is a scaling constant (see, for example, Eldridge and Morse 2008). 

#### Secondary Redox Reactions {-}

In Paraska et al (2014), many secondary redox reactions were identified that have been included across the diversity of diagenesis model applications. In CANDI-AED, they are all included as options, and may be turned on or off as desired (Table x).

#### Equilibrium Geochemistry {-}

The pH is calculated as the sum of all charged species, where any unbalanced positive charge indicates H^+^. The charge balance is at each time step is solved as a state variable, which is subject to advection, diffusion and bioturbation reactions.
 
The precipitation of minerals is solved as an equilibrium reaction, dependent on the concentrations of the dissolved and solid substances, their $K_{sp}$ and ion activity product (IAP). The equations are applied in a similar manner to those in Van Cappellen and Wang (1996) and numerous other studies, but with the exact forms of the equations based on those from Tufano et al. (2009) (Table x). A positive rate indicates precipitation and a negative rate indicates dissolution. This model applies the function to all mineral simulated, including Fe(OH)~3~, FeS, FeS~2~, FeCO~3~, CaCO~3~ and MnCO~3~. This model can also include the process of mineral ageing, whereby iron and manganese oxides become crystalline and no longer react with organic matter, but can still undergo secondary redox reactions. 

#### Physical Transport {-}

Advection and diffusion reactions are fairly consistent in diagenesis models, and CANDI-AED adopts the approach of Boudreau (1996). Porosity ($\phi$) is defined according to equation x, which allows it to decrease with depth, and the solid fraction is defined from $\phi_s=1-\phi)$. For bioturbation the model uses a diffusion coefficient that varies with depth ($D_{B(x)}$) as a two layer function or a Gaussian decrease (Boudreau 1996). For the porewater components, diffusion coefficients are used that are based on free-solution molecular diffusion constants corrected for sediment tortuosity, $θ$, according to equation x.

### Implementation within the AED framework

The sediment diagenesis model CANDI-AED can be used within the AED framework in various ways. This includes a) how teh SDG module links to other modules in simulating water variables, and b) how the module operates within the simulated domain.

####	Sediment-water coupling {-}

The sediment and hydrodynamic models are coupled at the sediment-water interface. The AED model setup has separate functions for coupling the bottom-most cell of a hydrodynamic model to the top-most layer of the sediment model:

-	flux of solid (particulate) material onto the sediment surface, $mmol/m^2/d$
-	concentration of dissolved substances in the bottom water, $mmol/m^3$
-	flux of dissolved substances from the top sediment layer to or from the water, $mmol/m^2/d$

knitr::include_graphics("images/23-sediment_biogeochemistry/sed_picture3.png")

```

Depending on the nature of the host hydrodynamic model, several configurations can be implemented:

<center>
```{r 23-pic6, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Spatial resolution options available through AED. a) Water column studies have traditionally assigned a flux to the sediment water interface without resolving the sediment chemical concentrations by depth, though they can be resolved laterally. b) The 0D water column is the method used in most sediment diagenesis studies, and use of multiple sediment zones is an option available within AED.", out.width = '95%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/23-sediment_biogeochemistry/image6.png")
```
</center>


####	Resolving sediment zonation {-}

Facility exists within the model to use sediment zones'\ which are identical to the above description but are not necessarily coincident with the grid-structure of the water (Figure \ref{fig:sed_integration}). This way "sed-zones" may be defined for the domain, allowing more efficient simulations. Using zones is a practical compromise between computational efficiency and capturing spatial heterogeneity in sediment properties and their fluxes.


```{r dev-pics3, echo = FALSE, out.width='100%', class = "text-image", fig.cap = "Schematic depicting sediment zone numerical approach."}

knitr::include_graphics("images/23-sediment_biogeochemistry/sed_picture5.png")

```

<br>

From a numerical point of view, depending on the nature of the grid, the water cells above the sediment will be averaged for the purposes of the interfacial fluxes (Figure \ref{fig:dev-pics4}).

knitr::include_graphics("images/23-sediment_biogeochemistry/sed_picture4.png")

```

#### Program Structure

The general structure of the program is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:23-pic7). The program is firstly initialised (including spin-up days if desired), then loops through the kinetic and equilibrium reactions for each time step and writes the resulting concentrations and rates at each depth to an output file. The kinetic reactions are solved by the VODE program (Brown et al. 1989) and the equilibrium reactions by the Simplex program.

## Setup & Configuration

The preceding details were an explanation of the scientific aspects of this diagenesis model, and next we turn to practical implementation.


### Model Setup, Boundary Conditions & Parameter Definition

Each active sediment model within this module is discretised into a user definable number of depth layers (`maxnpts`) that start at a thickness of a few mm at the sediment-water interface and which increase exponentially down to a pre-defined sediment depth (`xl`). Users must define the sediment domain physical properties as summarised in Table x, including configuration options related to bioturbation and irrigation. The biogeochemical configuration (Table x), rate constants (see Table x and Table x) must be set according to the sub-model options described above.

<br>

The initial conditions for each sedimemnt variable are set as a list by the `initial_vals`, which sets a constant concentration with depth in units of $\mu mol/L$. For organic matter initial concentrations only, there are three available options for the concentration with depth, set by `OMInitMethodL`. 

The sediment-water interface is the uppermost layer of the sediment, for which there are three configuration options set by the parameter `swibc_mode`. If the user specifies `swibc_mode = 2`, the concentration is a constant value set by `default_vals` in the `aed.nml` name list. For `swibc_mode = 0`, the concentration is provided by a “link_variable”, which provides the concentration from another simulated water column AED module. If the variable name in the link list is left blank (“ ”) then AED-CANDI will assume these variables are not linked to any water column variables and default to the `default_vals` values. If `swibc_mode = 10`, the concentration is provided by a user-prescribed temporally variable value read from the file `aed_sediment_swibc.dat`. This option may desirable, for example, for simulating a seasonally or daily changing boundary condition. 

Regardless of the `swibc_mode` surface boundary condition option, fluxes of dissolved species occur between the sediment and water column. They are calculated from the concentration gradient at the sediment-water interface according to Fick’s Law:

<center>
\begin{equation}
F = D_{0}\frac{\Delta C}{\Delta x} = \frac{D_{0}}{\delta} (C_{bw} - C_{1})
(\#eq:biogeochem1)
\end{equation}
</center>

where $D_{0}$ is the diffusivity, $\delta$ is the thickness of the diffusive boundary layer at the sediment water interface and defined as the length scale of the first sediment layer, $C_{bw}$ is the bottom water concentration and $C_{1}$ is the concentration in the top sediment layer.

At the bottom of the domain ($x$ = `xl`) the model can be specified to have a fixed-concentration (`deepbc_mode` = 0) such that the concentration at $xl = C_{Bot}$, or it can be specified to have a zero-derivative (`deepbc_mode` = 1) defined as $\frac{dC}{dx}=0$ at $x = xl$.


### Setup example

The model is set up via the name list text file `aed.nml` using the module keyword `&aed_seddiagenesis` and a model namelist block termed `&aed_sediment` configured to select the `sediment_model` as “Dynamic” or “Dynamic2D” option. Once this is selected, the model will search for the `&aed_sedcandi` parameter block.

An example `aed.nml` configuration block for the `aed_seddiagenesis` module that includes multiple active sediment zones, plus microphytobenthos (MPB) and seagrass links, is shown below:

As with other modules, the NetCDF files include the model outputs (see Table above). In addition, the module also writes output files for each variable as text files, giving time (in years) as the first column depth as the first row and concentrations in the other fields. These can be read in using a data processing program such as R, Matlab or Excel for analysis. Further, the model outputs the file `rates.sed` for each variable at every depth for the final time step.
