  abstract = {{Zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha, were collected monthly from April/May to November in 1990 and 1991 from two sites in Lake St. Clair. The sites were characterized by relatively high and low mussel densities. The following variables were measured: ash-free dry weight (AFDW) per unit shell length (SL), lipid content and classes, carbon content, and nitrogen content. Mussels from the high-density site had a lower AFDW:SL relationship, lower lipid content, and a lower C:N ratio than mussels from the low-density site. Seasonal trends in these variables were consistent between sites and years. AFDW:SL, lipid, and carbon content were highest in the spring and then declined to minimum levels in late summer/fall. The mean seasonal decline in weight from spring to late summer for a standard 15-mm mussel was 60\%. This decline was greater than might be expected from gamete release alone and was likely a result of nutritional stress from warm summer temperatures and limited food supplies. Between 1990 and 1991, the mean AFDW of a 15-mm mussel declined 34\% and 50\% at the high- and low-density site, respectively. However, when C:N ratios and lipid levels in 1990 and 1991 were compared, C:N ratios were only lower in fall 1991 compared to fall 1990, and lipid levels for the 2 years were generally similar.}},

This study investigated interactions of the lagoon with adjacent coastal waters and inland riverine inputs by modelling both the lagoon and the Northern Adriatic Sea, using a coupled three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic-ecological model (ELCOM-CAEDYM) adapted to include the clam population. The clam model accounted for carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) biomass in the benthos through parameterisations for filtration, excretion, egestion, respiration, mortality, and harvesting. Multiple clam size classes were included in a new population dynamics sub-model. Output from the coupled model was validated against hydrodynamic and water quality data from intensive field sampling and routine monitoring. Time scales of tidal flushing, primary production and clam grazing were investigated with the model to demonstrate that food supply to clam populations is dominated by phytoplankton inputs from the Northern Adriatic Sea. Effects of clam cultivation on nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton biomass in Barbamarco Lagoon were primarily localised, with strong tidal flushing minimising impacts of clam filtration on lagoon-wide nutrient concentrations at current clam stocking levels. Clam populations were found to alter the cycling of nutrients in the system, causing the lagoon to become a net sink for particulate organic matter and to export dissolved organic matter to the adjacent sea via tidal flushing. Ecosystem health and sensitivity of nutrient cycles to clam cultivation are important considerations for the long term sustainable management and potential expansion of the fishery.}},

To evaluate whether mussels can reasonably be expected to mediate such changes, we extended the three-dimensional hydrodynamic-ecological model (ELCOM-CAEDYM) to include mussels as a state variable and applied it to Lake Erie (USA-Canada). Mussel-mediated decreases in mean phytoplankton biomass were highly sensitive to the assigned mussel population size in each basin. In the relatively deep east basin, mussels were predicted to decrease phytoplankton in both nearshore and offshore zones, even during periods of thermal stratification but especially during the spring phytoplankton maximum. Spatially, impacts were associated with mussel distributions but could be strong even in areas without high mussel biomass, consistent with advection from areas of higher mussel biomass. The results supported the nearshore shunt hypothesis that mussel impacts on phytoplankton should be greater in nearshore than offshore waters and also supported suggestions about the emerging importance of deep water offshore mussels. The results of this study provide an important insight into ecological role of mussels in lowering plankton productivity in some world’s largest lakes.}},

Mussels were acclimated to either 5, 15 or 25 °C for at least 2 weeks and their respiratory response to progressive hypoxia was measured at three test temperatures (5, 15 and 25 °C). The degree of oxygen regulation increased with increasing test temperature, particularly from 5 to 15 °C, but decreased with increasing acclimation temperature. The decreased metabolic rate observed for warm-acclimated animals, particularly in the upper portion of the temperature range of the zebra mussel, may allow for conservation of organic energy stores during warm summer months. Compared to other freshwater bivalves, D. polymorpha is a relatively poor oxygen regulator, corresponding with its preference for well-oxygenated aquatic habitats. In addition, a new quantitative method for determining the degree of oxygen regulation is presented.}},

We used data from 1997 to calibrate the model, and data from 1998 and 1999 to verify it. The simulated surface and bottom water temperatures show good agreement with field observations. In spite of limitations of this 2D model and data availability, the simulated values of biological and nutrient state variables match well with field measurements. Although EcoLE's performance for the verification years is as good as that of the calibration year, the wide standard deviations of both field measurements and model simulations as well as the complexity of an ecosystem of this size make us consider our model more as a valid analytical tool rather than a predictive one at this moment. Nevertheless, we have constructed the first fine-scale dynamic ecological model of a large lake that couples hydrodynamics and detailed food web of lower trophic levels and is driven by real-time air temperature and wind conditions and the inputs from the atmosphere and tributaries. Using the model we investigate the impacts of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga mussels (D. bugensis) on phytoplankton of Lake Erie. The simulation results show that dreissenid grazing impacts on non-diatom edible algae (NDEA) are weakened by the boundary layer above the basin bottom. However, dreissenid grazing impacts on diatoms are less affected by the boundary layer due to the higher sinking rates of diatoms. Dreissenid mussels increase non-diatom inedible algae (NDIA) rapidly with increasing mussel population size, because the dreissenid population excretes a large amount of ammonia and phosphate. Our results indicate that dreissenid mussels have weak direct grazing impacts on algal biomass, while indirect effects of their nutrient excretion have a greater impact on the system.}},

A positive correlation was found between C:N:P stoichiometry of seston and elemental composition of zebra mussel in one of the lakes. Tissue C:N and N:P ratios were the main factors that related to zebra mussel condition index. Zebra mussel condition was positively related to tissue C:N ratio. Smaller Dreissena had higher C:N ratio than larger Dreissena in two of the four lakes. Zebra mussels in the lake with highest productivity had lower C:P and N:P ratios than zebra mussels in the lake with lowest productivity. Our study suggests that the zebra mussel may modify their phosphorus content in relation to lake trophic state, and therefore cope with stoichiometric constraints which may explain the invasion success of this and other related species.}},

We found significant differences in excretion rate both between size classes within a taxon and between taxa, with zebra mussels generally having greater nutrient excretion rates than quagga mussels. Combining measured excretion rates with measurements of mussel soft-tissue dry weight and shell length, we developed nutrient excretion equations allowing estimation of nutrient excretion by dreissenids. 3. Comparing dreissenid ammonia and phosphate excretion with that of the crustacean zooplankton, we demonstrated that the mussels add to nitrogen and phosphorus remineralisation, shortening nitrogen and phosphorus turnover times, and, importantly, modify the nitrogen and phosphorus cycles in Lake Erie. The increased nutrient flux from dreissenids may facilitate phytoplankton growth and cyanobacterial blooms in well-mixed and/or shallow areas of western Lake Erie.}},

Blooms of Microcystis, a toxin-producing blue-green alga, became re-established in the bay after the zebra mussel invasion. Microcystis blooms had all but been eliminated in the early 1980s with controls on external phosphorus loadings, but have re-occurred in the bay most summers since 1992. An apparent paradox is that these recent Microcystis blooms have not been accompanied by increases in external phosphorus loadings. An ecosystem model was used to investigate whether the re-occurrence of Microcystis could be due to changes caused by zebra mussels that impacted phytoplankton community structure and/or internal phosphorus dynamics. The model was first used to establish baseline conditions in Saginaw Bay for 1991, before zebra mussels significantly impacted the system. The baseline model was then used to investigate: (1) the composite impacts of zebra mussels with average 1991–1995 densities; (2) sensitivity to changes in zebra mussel densities and external phosphorus loadings; and (3) three hypotheses on potential causative factors for proliferation of blue-green algae. Under the model assumptions, selective rejection of blue-green algae by zebra mussels appears to be a necessary factor in the enhancement of blue-green production in the presence of zebra mussels. Enhancement also appears to depend on the increased sediment-water phosphorus flux associated with the presence of zebra mussels, the magnitude of zebra mussel densities, and the distribution of zebra mussel densities among different age groups.}},

Field data were collected on stream temperature and discharge, weather, and lake temperatures at varying depths to calibrate and validate the model for Oneida Lake. Modeled temperatures at 2m and 10m were generally within ±1°C of observed values, but only after wind speeds from a nearby airport were decreased by 25\%. Downscaled climate data from three general circulation models and two emissions scenarios were used to assess the impacts of different anticipated climate scenarios on the lake for 2041–2050 and 2090–2099. By 2050, under the higher emissions scenario, water temperatures (April–November) at 2m and 10m depths indicated an increase of 1.36°C and 1.43°C, respectively; however, 2011 simulation temperatures already aligned with mid-century predictions. By the end of the century, the prediction of the higher emissions scenario indicated an increase in 2m and 10m water temperatures (April–November) of 3.70°C and 3.37°C, respectively, and an increase of 61 consecutive days of stratification in Oneida Lake. These impacts would lead to increased periods of lack of oxygen in the bottom waters of this lake and changes in the biotic species composition, including extirpation of a coldwater fish species, burbot (Lota lota).

In shallow (< 9 m) waters, both mussels were more abundant on rock than sand and silt substrate. Only QMs were abundant in deep silt substrate. The shift from ZM to QM dominance increased total biomass, but not density, due to larger QMs. Veliger densities were higher in May and August–November after arrival of QMs; however, there was no correlation between number of veligers and new recruits in fall or adult mussel biomass. The replacement of ZM occurred over about 4 years even though published mechanisms for QM dominance are not operating in summer in Oneida Lake.}},

We enhance the mechanistic foundation of a simple TP mass-balance model, originally developed to guide the eutrophication management in the system. The structural improvements include the incorporation of macrophyte dynamics, the explicit representation of the role of dreissenids in the system, and the improved portrayal of the interplay between water column and sediments. Our model provides good agreement with the observed TP variability in the system during the study period (1999–2007). Consistent with empirical evidence, our model predicts that macrophyte uptake from the interstitial waters is responsible for a significant loss of P from the sediments. Our model also suggests that dreissenids filter a considerable amount of particulate P from the water column, but the effective clearance rate is significantly lower with a substantial amount of the filtered particles (>85\%) returned into the water column as faeces, pseudofeces or other metabolic excreta. P diffusive fluxes from the sediments account for about 30–35\% of the exogenous P loading in Lake Simcoe. The sediments in the main basin are mostly driven by fast diagenetic processes of settling organic matter from the epilimnion, suggesting an internal P loading of 9.2tonnes yr−1. Finally, our study attempts to explain the lack of distinct decreasing trends in ice-free TP concentrations after the invasion of dreissenid mussels, suggesting that the presence of active nutrient recycling pathways, potentially magnified by the particular morphological features and hydrodynamic patterns of Lake Simcoe, could counterbalance the direct effects of dreissenid filtration.}},

For the Great Lakes, the following predictions were made: zebra mussels have bimodal growth patterns, with rapid growth in the spring and fall during periods of high food availability and moderate temperatures; growth rates are highest in Lake Ontario and lowest in Lake Superior, reflecting the trophic gradient in the Great Lakes; based on published weight/fecundity relationships, zebra mussels reach reproductive size in all of the Great Lakes except the main body of Lake Superior; and local eutrophication (e.g. Duluth/Superior Harbor) increases zebra mussel growth rates. Modelled consumption rates in Lakes Erie and Ontario are also consistent with rates of consumption by the zebra mussel in eutrophic and mesotrophic European lakes.}},
