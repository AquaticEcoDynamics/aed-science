abstract = {{Oxygen depletion in coastal and estuarine waters has been increasing rapidly around the globe over the past several decades, leading to decline in water quality and ecological health. In this study we apply a numerical model to understand how salt wedge dynamics, changes in river flow and temperature together control oxygen depletion in a micro-tidal riverine estuary, the Yarra River estuary, Australia. Coupled physical–biogeochemical models have been previously applied to study how hydrodynamics impact upon seasonal hypoxia; however, their application to relatively shallow, narrow riverine estuaries with highly transient patterns of river inputs and sporadic periods of oxygen depletion has remained challenging, largely due to difficulty in accurately simulating salt wedge dynamics in morphologically complex areas. In this study we overcome this issue through application of a flexible mesh 3-D hydrodynamic–biogeochemical model in order to predict the extent of salt wedge intrusion and consequent patterns of oxygen depletion. The extent of the salt wedge responded quickly to the sporadic riverine flows, with the strength of stratification and vertical density gradients heavily influenced by morphological features corresponding to shallow points in regions of tight curvature ("horseshoe" bends). The spatiotemporal patterns of stratification led to the emergence of two "hot spots" of anoxia, the first downstream of a shallow region of tight curvature and the second downstream of a sill. Whilst these areas corresponded to regions of intense stratification, it was found that antecedent conditions related to the placement of the salt wedge played a major role in the recovery of anoxic regions following episodic high flow events. Furthermore, whilst a threshold salt wedge intrusion was a requirement for oxygen depletion, analysis of the results allowed us to quantify the effect of temperature in determining the overall severity and extent of hypoxia and anoxia. Climate warming scenarios highlighted that oxygen depletion is likely to be exacerbated through changes in flow regimes and warming temperatures; however, the increasing risk of hypoxia and anoxia can be mitigated through management of minimum flow allocations and targeted reductions in organic matter loading. A simple statistical model (R2 > 0.65) is suggested to relate riverine flow and temperature to the extent of estuary-wide anoxia.}},

Therefore, it is essential to predict the future changes and develop mitigation measures to combat such pressures. In this study, Lake Beyşehir, the largest freshwater lake in the Mediterranean basin, was selected to study the impacts of climate change and various land use scenarios on the ecosystem dynamics of Mediterranean freshwater ecosystems and the services that they provide. For this purpose, we linked catchment model outputs to the two different processed-based lake models: PCLake and GLM-AED, and tested the scenarios of five General Circulation Models, two Representation Concentration Pathways and three different land use scenarios, which enable us to consider the various sources of uncertainty. Climate change and land use scenarios generally predicted strong future decreases in hydraulic and nutrient loads from the catchment to the lake. These changes in loads translated into alterations in water level as well as minor changes in chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentrations. We also observed an increased abundance of cyanobacteria in both lake models. Total phosphorus, temperature and hydraulic loading were found to be the most important variables determining cyanobacteria biomass. As the future scenarios revealed only minor changes in Chl-a due to the significant decrease in nutrient loads, our results highlight that reduced nutrient loading in a warming world may play a crucial role in offsetting the effects of temperature on phytoplankton growth. However, our results also showed increased abundance of cyanobacteria in the future may threaten ecosystem integrity and may limit drinking water ecosystem services. In addition, extended periods of decreased hydraulic loads from the catchment and increased evaporation may lead to water level reductions and may diminish the ecosystem services of the lake as a water supply for irrigation and drinking water.}},

abstract = {{ Bubble-plume mixing systems are often deployed in eutrophic lakes and reservoirs to manage phytoplankton taxa. Unfortunately, inconsistent outcomes from bubble-plume (induced) mixing are often reported in the literature. The present study investigates the response of phytoplankton to induced mixing using a whole-reservoir field experiment and a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model (Si3D) coupled with the Aquatic EcoDynamics (AED) model through the framework for aquatic biogeochemical modelling (FABM). The coupled Si3D-AED model is validated against a 24-h field mixing experiment and subsequently used for a numerical parametric study to investigate phytoplankton responses to various induced mixing scenarios in which the phytoplankton settling rate, phytoplankton growth rate, reservoir depth, and mixing system diffuser depth were sequentially varied. Field observations during the mixing experiment suggest that the total phytoplankton concentration (measured in μ g / L ) across the reservoir was reduced by nearly 10\% during the 24-h mixing period. The numerical modeling results show that phytoplankton concentration may be substantially affected by the functional traits of the phytoplankton and the deployment depth of the mixing diffuser. Interestingly, the numerical results indicate that the phytoplankton concentration is controlled by reduced growth rates due to light limitation in deep reservoirs (>20 m), whereas settling loss is a more important factor in shallow reservoirs during the mixing period. In addition, the coupled Si3D-AED model results suggest that deploying the mixing diffuser deeper in the water column to increase mixing depth may generally improve the successful management of cyanobacteria using bubble-plume mixing systems. Thus, the coupled Si3D-AED model introduced in the present study can assist with the design and operation of bubble-plume mixing systems.}},

Here, we hypothesise that ignoring physiological differences and competition between species when managing wetland hydrologic regimes can lead to a decrease in vegetation diversity, even when the overall wetland carrying capacity is improved. Using an ecohydrological model capable of resolving water-vegetation-salt feedbacks, we investigate why water surface and groundwater management interventions to combat vegetation decline have been more beneficial to Casuarina obesa than to Melaleuca strobophylla, the co-dominant tree species in Lake Toolibin, a salt-affected wetland in Western Australia. The simulations reveal that in trying to reduce the negative effect of salinity, the management interventions have created an environment favouring C. obesa by intensifying the climate-induced trend that the wetland has been experiencing of lower water availability and higher root-zone salinity. By testing alternative scenarios, we show that interventions that improve M. strobophylla biomass are possible by promoting hydrologic conditions that are less specific to the niche requirements of C. obesa. Modelling uncertainties were explored via a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Overall, the study demonstrates the importance of including species differentiation and competition in ecohydrological models that form the basis for wetland management.}},

Understanding their dynamics and driving factors is of great importance to manage bloom events and their consequences. Ecosystem models enable us to simulate, analyze and understand ecological processes in complex aquatic ecosystems. In this work, we examined the ability of the General Lake Model-Aquatic EcoDynamics (GLM-AED), an open-access one dimensional hydrodynamic-ecological model to simulate physical variables and the dynamics of two cyanobacterial species in 2016. The effect of possible hydrological and climatic scenarios on cyanobacterial blooms occurrence was also investigated. Results indicate that the model was able to accurately reproduce changes in water level (MAPE of 0.4\%), water temperature profiles (MAPE of 5 to 7\%) and the biomass of Microcystis aeruginosa and Chrysosporum (Aphanizomenon) ovalisporum at the study area. Dramatic changes were observed under warming trends including increase in both the length of the stratification period and in cyanobacteria bloom dynamics. Data analysis revealed that while water temperature was the primary factor determining cyanobacterial succession and occurrence, other factors such as water level fluctuations and irradiance are also important. Our findings suggest that any further increase in temperature would promote the development of potentially toxic cyanobacterial blooms at Karaoun Reservoir. The good performance of the model will provide essential insights required for deeper ecological understanding and water quality management.}},

abstract = {{ Understanding potential effects of climate warming on biogeochemical cycling in freshwater ecosystems is of pressing importance. Specifically, increasing air and water temperatures could accelerate nutrient cycling in lakes, which has major implications for in-lake nutrient concentrations, water column nutrient stoichiometry, and downstream nutrient export. Lakes may respond differentially to warming based on their current trophic state, although direct comparisons of temperature-driven changes in nutrient cycling between low- and high-nutrient lakes are lacking. Here, we used an open-source coupled hydrodynamic biogeochemical model to simulate ecosystem-scale changes in water column total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations and TN:TP ratios due to potential incremental changes in air temperature (from +0 °C to +6 °C) in a low-nutrient and a high-nutrient lake. Warming resulted in lower TN and higher TP epilimnetic (surface water) concentrations in both lakes, resulting in reduced molar TN:TP ratios in both lakes. While the high- and low-nutrient lakes had similar magnitude reductions in TN:TP ratio between the +0 °C and +6 °C scenarios (30.3\% and 34.6\%, respectively), median epilimnetic TN:TP in the low-nutrient lake significantly decreased with as little as 1 °C of warming. Warming also altered net nutrient retention, with decreased downstream export of TN but increased downstream export of TP in both lakes. Our modeling results suggest that low-nutrient lakes may respond to warming at lower levels of temperature increase than high-nutrient lakes, and that climate warming could intensify effects of nutrient enrichment driven by increased N and P loading due to land-use change.}},

Application of these models to future projections relies on the time invariance of the calibrated model parameters and of the adopted schematisation. This is mere speculation for real ecosystems, so that it is relevant to explore the limits of coupled models over extended periods. To date, almost all applications in literature have been calibrated over a couple of years at most, with comparable validation periods, if present. Furthermore, past studies mostly concerned shallow to moderately deep small lakes, so that reproducing the hypolimnetic chemical evolution of very deep large lakes has generally been overlooked. Last, most works did not compare with observations or even model the succession of phytoplankton species, but only dealt with total Chlorophyll-a. Here, the GLM-AED2 (General Lake Model – Aquatic EcoDynamics) coupled model was calibrated and validated for an overall 16.75-year period for the 370-m deep and 213-km2 wide Lake Maggiore (Northern Italy/Southern Switzerland), focusing on the reproduction of both deep-water chemistry and phytoplankton biomass and succession. Despite the modelling simplifications needed for this complex basin, the resulting performances are comparable to those in literature for shallower and smaller lakes over shorter periods. Still, extreme care must be put when interpreting the results of coupled ecological-hydrodynamic models for long-term projections, especially regarding the evolution of phytoplankton.}},

In deep lakes, stratification enhancement and mixing reduction have already been observed, leading to hypolimnetic anoxia and to the rise of cyanophytes. The increase in stability depends on the rise of air temperature due to global emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). Primary production could then either increase with rising epilimnetic temperature and buoyancy or decrease as fewer nutrients are upwelled from deep layers. The prevailing outcome, as well as the quantitative and temporal dynamics of all climate-induced modifications, depend on the specific lake characteristics. Individual analyses are then needed, one-dimensional coupled hydrodynamic-ecological numerical models being suitable tools for such predictions. Here, we simulated with GLM-AED2 (General Lake Model – Aquatic EcoDynamics) the 2020-2085 dynamics of the oligomictic and oligotrophic deep subalpine Lake Maggiore (Italy/Switzerland), according to the Swiss Climate Change Scenarios CH2011. Multiple realisations were performed for each scenario with random meteorological series obtained from the Vector-Autoregressive Weather Generator (VG), highlighting the uncertainties related to meteorology. Increase and decrease of nutrient loads were also tested. Results show that anoxia would occur in the hypolimnion regardless of nutrient input reduction, unless global GHG emissions were immediately reduced. Total phytoplankton biomass would be weakly affected by climate change, strongly depending on nutrient input, yet water warming would cause cyanophytes to compete with diatoms. Therefore, the fate of Lake Maggiore would be tied to both global and local environmental policies.}},

As part of a multi-pronged strategy to tackle the problem of eutrophication in the Swan-Canning estuary, oxygenation plants have been installed in the upper reaches of the estuary to counteract the high oxygen demand and prevent hypoxia. In this study, we developed a three-dimensional hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model to simulate oxygen dynamics and assess the cost-benefit of different oxygenation operation regimes (e.g., night operation, all day operation or tidally-optimised operation). The model accurately captured the salt-wedge dynamics and the extent and severity of hypoxia under low and high flow conditions. The artificial oxygenation is shown to significantly improve oxygen conditions in the targeted zone under low flow conditions. The scenario assessment revealed a two-term power relationship between total oxygen supply and areal benefit, with scenarios highlighting that adding more oxygen would improve the oxygen conditions to a greater extent up to a limit (i.e., the law of diminishing returns). The total areal benefit achieved was found to be dependent on the total oxygen load rather than the timing of the oxygen input regime. The results also suggest that when designing an artificial oxygenation plant for an estuarine environment, the locations of oxygen addition should be carefully selected within the context of the local hydrology to achieve optimum results in target areas.}},

Here, we used the one-dimensional hydrodynamic General Lake Model coupled to Aquatic EcoDynamics modules (GLM-AED) to simulate 11 years of nitrogen-fixing and non-nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterial biomass in Lake Mendota (Madison, WI, USA). We developed climate scenarios with either uniform (constant) warming or variable warming based on random sampling of daily air temperatures from either a normal or Poisson probability distribution. We found that while the median cyanobacterial biomass among repeated simulations for each of the years was similar regardless of whether or not air temperature variability was included in the climate scenarios, the randomly-sampled air temperature distribution scenarios exhibited much greater variability in the year-to-year cyanobacterial biomass estimates. Our results suggest that including temperature variability in climate scenarios may substantially change our understanding of how climate warming may alter cyanobacterial blooms over yearly to decadal time scales. To more effectively predict the range of possible future cyanobacterial dynamics, both the magnitude and variability of warming must be considered when developing climate scenarios for lake modeling studies.}},

After calibration against measured flow and water temperature data over a two-month period with three storm events, the model was successfully validated against high frequency dissolved oxygen (DO) data exhibiting large diurnal fluctuations. The results demonstrated that pulses of high-DO water injected into the wetland during storm events were able to dramatically change the wetland oxygen budget. A shift was observed in the dominant oxygen inputs, from benthic net production during non-storm periods, to inflows of oxygen during storm events, which served to dampen the classical diurnal oxygen signature. The model also demonstrated the changing balance of pelagic versus benthic production and hypoxia extent in response to storm events, which has implications for the nutrient attenuation performance of constructed wetlands.

Decreases in oxygen concentration leads to altered ecosystem function as well as harmful consequences for aquatic biota, such as fishes. The responses of oxygen dynamics in lakes to climate-related drivers, such as temperature and wind speed, are well documented for lake surface waters. However, much less is known about how the oxic environment of bottom waters, especially the timing and magnitude of anoxia in eutrophic lakes, responds to changes in climate drivers. Understanding how important ecosystem states, such as hypolimnetic anoxia, may respond to differing climate scenarios requires a model that couples physical-biological conditions and sufficiently captures the density stratification that leads to strong oxygen gradients. Here, we analyzed the effects of changes in three important meteorological drivers (air temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity) on hypolimnetic anoxia in a eutrophic, north temperate lake using the anoxic factor as an index that captures both the temporal and spatial extent of anoxia. Air temperature and relative humidity were found to have a positive correlation with anoxic factor, while wind speed had a negative correlation. Air temperature was found to have the greatest potential impact of the three drivers on the anoxic factor, followed by wind speed and then relative humidity. Across the scenarios of climate variability, variation in the simulated anoxic factor was primarily due to changes in the timing of onset and decay of stratification. Given the potential for future changes in climate, especially increases in air temperature, this study provides important insight into how these changes will alter lake water quality.}},

The relative importance of climate and land‐use drivers has been examined primarily for mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes. However, oligotrophic lakes show different sensitivity to climate and land‐use drivers than mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes, necessitating further exploration of the relative contribution of the two drivers of change to increased phytoplankton abundance. Here, we investigated how air temperature (a driver related to climate change) and nutrient load (a driver related to land‐use and climate change) interact to alter water quality in oligotrophic Lake Sunapee, New Hampshire, USA. We used long‐term data and the one‐dimensional hydrodynamic General Lake Model (GLM) coupled with Aquatic EcoDyanmics (AED) modules to simulate water quality. Over the 31‐year simulation, summer median chlorophyll‐a concentration was positively associated with summer air temperature, whereas annual maximum chlorophyll‐a concentration was positively associated with the previous three years of external phosphorus load. Scenario testing demonstrated a 2°C increase in air temperature significantly increased summer median chlorophyll‐a concentration, but not annual maximum chlorophyll‐a concentration. For both maximum and median chlorophyll‐a concentration, doubling external nutrient loads of total nitrogen and total phosphorus at the same time, or doubling phosphorus alone, resulted in a significant increase. This study highlights the importance of aligning lake measurements with the ecosystem metrics of interest, as maximum chlorophyll‐a concentration may be more uniquely sensitive to nutrient load, and that typical summer chlorophyll‐a concentration may increase due to warming alone. Clear water lakes are experiencing more frequent water quality problems due to land development and climate change. However, it is challenging to identify how land development and climate change interact to alter water quality because their effects are complex and occurring at the same time. We used three decades of observational data combined with a lake ecosystem simulation model to explore the role of land development and climate change on water quality. Our water quality indicator of focus was phytoplankton, which are small photosynthesizing organisms in the water, often referred to as “algae.” We found that the effects of land use and climate depend on if we look at yearly maximum or average phytoplankton concentrations. Average phytoplankton concentrations during the summer (representing typical summer conditions) increase with either warmer air temperatures or higher nutrient pollution. However, annual maximum phytoplankton concentration (representing phytoplankton “blooms”) only increases with higher nutrient pollution. Typical summer phytoplankton concentrations will likely increase with warmer air temperatures due to climate change alone, and increase even further when combined with higher nutrient pollution. To maintain clear water lakes, nutrient pollution should be reduced even more than previously thought to compensate for increasing phytoplankton in a warmer climate. Simulated annual maximum and summer median lake chlorophyll‐a are positively associated with external phosphorus load and air temperature, respectively A 2°C rise in simulated air temperature significantly increased summer median, but not annual maximum, chlorophyll‐a Annual maximum chlorophyll‐a may be more informative than median summer chlorophyll‐a to assess nutrient load effects on water quality}},

abstract = {{Sustainable management of drinking water reservoirs requires balancing the demands of water supply whilst minimizing environmental impact. This study numerically simulates the effect of an improved withdrawal scheme designed to alleviate the temperature pollution downstream of a reservoir. The aim was to identify an optimal withdrawal strategy such that water of a desirable discharge temperature can be supplied downstream without leading to unacceptably low oxygen concentrations within the reservoir. First, we calibrated a one-dimensional numerical model for hydrodynamics and oxygen dynamics (GLM-AED2), verifying that the model reproduced water temperatures and hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen concentrations accurately over a 5 year period. Second, the model was extended to include an adaptive withdrawal functionality, allowing for a prescribed withdrawal temperature to be found, with the potential constraint of hypolimnetic oxygen concentration. Scenario simulations on epi-/metalimnetic withdrawal demonstrate that the model is able to autonomously determine the best withdrawal height depending on the thermal structure and the hypolimnetic oxygen concentration thereby optimizing the ability to supply a desirable discharge temperature to the downstream river during summer. This new withdrawal strategy also increased the hypolimnetic raw water volume to be used for drinking water supply, but reduced the dissolved oxygen concentrations in the deep and cold water layers (hypolimnion). Implications of the results for reservoir management are discussed and the numerical model is provided for operators as a simple and efficient tool for optimizing the withdrawal strategy within different reservoir contexts.}},

We develop a novel coupling between a limnology model of within-lake hydrodynamics and an economic model of property prices to support integrated assessments of actions to protect or improve water quality. We find, in the context of Lake Mendota that is eutrophic with high concentrations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P), that there is a nonlinear response in water quality to changes in nutrient loading. Reductions in nutrient loading result in much larger improvements in water quality than the magnitude of water quality deterioration with a similar size increase in nutrient loading. Given the in-situ concentrations of N and P in the lake, large reductions in nutrient loading are required to have a substantial impact on water quality.}},

abstract = {{Abstract Chagan Lake serves as an irrigation storage reservoir for the Qianguo Irrigation Area and an important ecological barrier in western Jilin. The coupled TUFLOW-FV and Aquatic Ecodynamic (AED2) models were used to simulate the hydrodynamic and water quality of Chagan Lake, and propose the water diversion scheme that could improve the water quality to reach Grade III and maintain the ecological water level. The simulation results showed a satisfactory agreement with observations. The total carrying loads of NH3-N, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) for Chagan Lake were 1,147.6, 3,686.2 and 100.8 t from May to October. The range of the minimum amounts of water diversion to keep the water quality as Grade III and maintain the maximum ecological water level of 131.5 m for TN, TP were separately [32.60, 49.84, 57.19, 63.70, 70.91], [117.25, 135.26, 168.17, 190.65, 218.32] million m3 and the corresponding reduction amounts of farmland drainage for TN, TP were separately [4.03, 0, 0, 0, 0], [73.08, 61.88, 50.23, 40.94, 31.98] million m3 under the rainfall guarantee rates of 10\%, 20\%, 50\%, 75\%, 90\%, respectively. The simulation results provide a scientific basis for the water quality improvement and ecological water supplement required for the interconnected river–lake system network (IRLSN) in Western Jilin Province.}},

abstract = {{Estuaries make an important contribution to the global greenhouse gas budget. Yet modeling predictions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions from estuaries remain highly uncertain due to both simplified assumptions about the underpinning hydrologic and biologic processes and inadequate data availability to uniquely define parameters related to CO2 and CH4 processes. This study presents a modeling framework to quantify the sensitivity and uncertainty of predicted CO2 and CH4 concentrations and emissions, which is demonstrated through application to a subtropical urban estuary (Brisbane River, Australia). A 3D hydrodynamic‐biogeochemical model was constructed, and calibrated using the model‐independent Parameter ESTimation software (PEST) with field data sets that captured strong gradients of CO2 and CH4 concentrations and emissions along the estuary. The approach refined uncertainty in the estimation of whole‐estuary annual emissions, and enabled us to assess the sensitivity and uncertainty of CO2 and CH4 dynamics. Estuarine CO2 concentrations were most sensitive to uncertainty in riverine inputs, whereas estuarine CH4 concentrations were most sensitive to sediment production and pelagic oxidation. Over the modeled year, variance in the daily fluctuations in carbon emissions from this case‐study spanned the full range of emission rates reported for estuaries around the world, highlighting that spatially or temporally limited sampling regimes could significantly bias estuarine greenhouse gas emission estimates. The combination of targeted field campaigns with the modeling approach presented in this study can help to improve carbon budgeting in estuaries, reduce uncertainty in emission estimates, and support management strategies to reduce or offset estuary greenhouse gas emissions. Global estuaries are a major source of CO2 emission and play a disproportionate role in global carbon cycling relative to their area. Estuaries are also a source of CH4 that has approximately 34 times the global‐warming potential of CO2 over a 100‐year time period. However, large uncertainties remain in estimating the CO2 and CH4 emissions from estuaries due to limited observations to cover their large spatiotemporal variations, and lack of knowledge of their dynamics in response to the external inputs and internal biogeochemical reactions. In this study, we developed a modeling framework to address the sensitivity and uncertainty of CO2 and CH4 dynamics in the Brisbane River Estuary to both the riverine and wastewater inputs and biogeochemical reaction parameters. We showed that CO2 concentrations were most sensitive to catchment inputs and CH4 concentrations were most sensitive to the rate of sediment production and oxidation in the water. The estimated annual‐total CO2 equivalent emission from Brisbane River Estuary in 2016 was 3,514 ± 445 tonnes. The combination of targeted field campaigns with the modeling approach can help to improve carbon budgeting in estuaries, reduce uncertainty in emission estimates, and support management strategies to reduce or offset estuary greenhouse gas emissions.
