The key pathways modeled include diffusive and bubble release of CH4 from the sediment, aerobic CH4 oxidation, and atmospheric gas exchange. The temporal and spatial dynamics of dissolved CH4 concentrations observed in the lake during 3 years could be well represented by the combined models. Remarkably, the relative contributions of ebullition and diffusive transport to the accumulation of CH4 in the hypolimnion during the stratified period could not be accurately constrained based only on the observed evolution of CH4 concentrations in the water column. Importantly, however, our analysis showed that most (∼99\%) of the CH4 supplied to the water column by bubble dissolution and diffusive transport from the sediment is aerobically oxidized, whereas a substantial fraction (∼60\%) of the sediment-released bubble CH4 is directly transported to the atmosphere. Ebullition is thus responsible for the bulk of the emissions from Lake Kinneret to the atmosphere. Therefore, as in all freshwaters, ebullition quantification is crucial for accurately assessing CH4 emissions to the atmosphere. This task remains challenging due to high spatio-temporal variability, but combining in situ measurements with a process-based modeling can help to better constrain flux estimates.}},

abstract = {{Methane emission pathways and their importance were quantified during a yearlong survey of a temperate hydropower reservoir. Measurements using gas traps indicated very high ebullition rates, but due to the stochastic nature of ebullition a mass balance approach was crucial to deduce system-wide methane sources and losses. Methane diffusion from the sediment was generally low and seasonally stable and did not account for the high concentration of dissolved methane measured in the reservoir discharge. A strong positive correlation between water temperature and the observed dissolved methane concentration enabled us to quantify the dissolved methane addition from bubble dissolution using a system-wide mass balance. Finally, knowing the contribution due to bubble dissolution, we used a bubble model to estimate bubble emission directly to the atmosphere. Our results indicated that the total methane emission from Lake Wohlen was on average >150 mg CH4 m−2 d−1, which is the highest ever documented for a midlatitude reservoir. The substantial temperature-dependent methane emissions discovered in this 90-year-old reservoir indicate that temperate water bodies can be an important but overlooked methane source.}},

The continental shelves, however, take up CO2 (∼0.25 Pg C y−1) from the atmosphere, accounting for approximately 17\% of open ocean CO2 uptake (1.5 Pg C y−1). It is demonstrated here that CO2 release in estuaries is largely supported by microbial decomposition of highly productive intertidal marsh biomass. It appears that riverine OC, however, would bypass the estuarine zone, because of short river-transit times, and contribute to carbon cycling in the ocean margins and interiors. Low-latitude ocean margins release CO2 because they receive two-thirds of the terrestrial OC. Because of recent CO2 increase in the atmosphere, CO2 releases from low latitudes have become weaker and CO2 uptake by mid- and high-latitude shelves has become stronger, thus leading to more dissolved inorganic carbon export to the ocean.}},

Photochemical reactions oxidize methane in the atmosphere; through these reactions, methane exerts strong influence over the chemistry of the troposphere and the stratosphere and many species including ozone, hydroxyl radicals, and carbon monoxide. Also, through its infrared absorption spectrum, methane is an important greenhouse gas in the climate system. We describe and enumerate key roles and reactions. Then we focus on two kinds of methane production: microbial and thermogenic. Microbial methanogenesis is described, and key organisms and substrates are identified along with their properties and habitats. Microbial methane oxidation limits the release of methane from certain methanogenic areas. Both aerobic and anaerobic oxidation are described here along with methods to measure rates of methane production and oxidation experimentally. Indicators of the origin of methane, including C and H isotopes, are reviewed. We identify and evaluate several constraints on the budget of atmospheric methane, its sources, sinks and residence time. From these constraints and other data on sources and sinks we construct a list of sources and sinks, identities, and sizes. The quasi‐steady state (defined in the text) annual source (or sink) totals about 310(±60) × 1012 mol (500(±95) × 1012 g), but there are many remaining uncertainties in source and sink sizes and several types of data that could lead to stronger constraints and revised estimates in the future.

Historical inorganic carbon measurements are scarce, so the progression of OA in the CCS is unknown. We used a multiple linear regression approach to generate empirical models using oxygen (O2), temperature (T), salinity (S), and sigma theta (σθ) as proxy variables to reconstruct pH, carbonate saturation states, carbonate ion concentration ([CO32−]), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration, and total alkalinity (TA) in the southern CCS. The calibration data included high-quality measurements of carbon, oxygen, and other hydrographic variables, collected during a cruise from British Columbia to Baja California in May–June 2007. All resulting empirical relationships were robust, withr2values >0.92 and low root mean square errors. Estimated and measured carbon chemistry matched very well for independent data sets from the CalCOFI and IMECOCAL programs. Reconstructed CCS pH and saturation states for 2005–2011 reveal a pronounced seasonal cycle and inter-annual variability in the upper water column. Deeper in the water column, conditions are stable throughout the annual cycle, with perennially low pH and saturation states. Over sub-decadal time scales, these empirical models provide a valuable tool for reconstructing carbonate chemistry related to ocean acidification where direct observations are limited. However, progressive increases in anthropogenic CO2 content of southern CCS water masses must be carefully addressed to apply the models over longer time scales.}},

The mutual consistency among these measured parameters is demonstrated using the inorganic carbon chemistry model with the dissociation constants for carbonic acid by Lueker et al. (2000) and for boric acid by Dickson (1990). Linear potential alkalinity-salinity relationships are established for 24 regions of the global ocean. The mean monthly distributions of pH and carbon chemistry parameters for the reference year 2005 are computed using the climatological mean monthly pCO2 data adjusted to a reference year 2005 and the alkalinity estimated from the potential alkalinity-salinity relationships. The equatorial zone (4°N-4°S) of the Pacific is excluded from the analysis because of the large interannual changes associated with ENSO events. The pH thus calculated ranges from 7.9 to 8.2. Lower values are located in the upwelling regions in the tropical Pacific and in the Arabian and Bering Seas; higher values are found in the subpolar and polar waters during the spring-summer months of intense photosynthetic production. The vast areas of subtropical oceans have seasonally varying pH values ranging from 8.05 during warmer months to 8.15 during colder months. The warm tropical and subtropical waters are supersaturated by a factor of as much as 4.2 with respect to aragonite and 6.3 for calcite, whereas the cold subpolar and polar waters are supersaturated by 1.2 for aragonite and 2.0 for calcite because of the lower pH values resulting from greater TCO2 concentrations. In the western Arctic Ocean, aragonite undersaturation is observed. The time-series data from the Bermuda (BATS), Hawaii (HOT), Canary (ESTOC) and the Drake Passage show that pH has been declining at a mean rate of about -0.02 pH per decade, and that pCO2 has been increasing at about 19 μatm per decade tracking the atmospheric pCO2 increase rate. This suggests that the ocean acidification is caused primarily by the uptake of atmospheric CO2. The relative importance of the four environmental drivers (temperature, salinity, alkalinity and total CO2 concentration) controlling the seasonal variability of carbonate chemistry at these sites is quantitatively assessed. The ocean carbon chemistry is governed sensitively by the TA/TCO2 ratio, and the rate of change in TA is equally important for the future ocean environment as is the TCO2 in ocean waters increases in the future.}},

The ability to accurately measure the carbonate system is the first step in characterizing the drivers behind this threat. Due to logistical realities, regular carbonate system sampling is not possible in many nearshore ocean habitats, particularly in remote, difficult-to-access locations. The ability to autonomously measure the carbonate system in situ relieves many of the logistical challenges; however, it is not always possible to measure the two required carbonate parameters autonomously. Observed relationships between sea surface salinity and total alkalinity can frequently provide a second carbonate parameter thus allowing for the calculation of the entire carbonate system. Here, we assessed the rigor of estimating total alkalinity from salinity at a depth <15 m by routinely sampling water from a pier in southern California for several carbonate system parameters. Carbonate system parameters based on measured values were compared with those based on estimated TA values. Total alkalinity was not predictable from salinity or from a combination of salinity and temperature at this site. However, dissolved inorganic carbon and the calcium carbonate saturation state of these nearshore surface waters could both be estimated within on average 5\% of measured values using measured pH and salinity-derived or regionally averaged total alkalinity. Thus we find that the autonomous measurement of pH and salinity can be used to monitor trends in coastal changes in DIC and saturation state and be a useful method for high-frequency, long-term monitoring of ocean acidification.}},

Little attention has been paid to the influence of variability in wind speed on the calculated gas transfer velocities and the possibility of chemical enhancement of CO2 exchange at low wind speeds over the ocean. The effect of these parameters is illustrated using a quadratic dependence of gas exchange on wind speed which is fit through gas transfer velocities over the ocean determined by the natural‐14C disequilibrium and the bomb‐14C inventory methods. Some of the variability between different data sets can be accounted for by the suggested mechanisms, but much of the variation appears due to other causes.

Yet modeling predictions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions from estuaries remain highly uncertain due to both simplified assumptions about the underpinning hydrologic and biologic processes and inadequate data availability to uniquely define parameters related to CO2 and CH4 processes. This study presents a modeling framework to quantify the sensitivity and uncertainty of predicted CO2 and CH4 concentrations and emissions, which is demonstrated through application to a subtropical urban estuary (Brisbane River, Australia). A 3D hydrodynamic‐biogeochemical model was constructed, and calibrated using the model‐independent Parameter ESTimation software (PEST) with field data sets that captured strong gradients of CO2 and CH4 concentrations and emissions along the estuary. The approach refined uncertainty in the estimation of whole‐estuary annual emissions, and enabled us to assess the sensitivity and uncertainty of CO2 and CH4 dynamics. Estuarine CO2 concentrations were most sensitive to uncertainty in riverine inputs, whereas estuarine CH4 concentrations were most sensitive to sediment production and pelagic oxidation. Over the modeled year, variance in the daily fluctuations in carbon emissions from this case‐study spanned the full range of emission rates reported for estuaries around the world, highlighting that spatially or temporally limited sampling regimes could significantly bias estuarine greenhouse gas emission estimates. The combination of targeted field campaigns with the modeling approach presented in this study can help to improve carbon budgeting in estuaries, reduce uncertainty in emission estimates, and support management strategies to reduce or offset estuary greenhouse gas emissions. Global estuaries are a major source of CO2 emission and play a disproportionate role in global carbon cycling relative to their area. Estuaries are also a source of CH4 that has approximately 34 times the global‐warming potential of CO2 over a 100‐year time period. However, large uncertainties remain in estimating the CO2 and CH4 emissions from estuaries due to limited observations to cover their large spatiotemporal variations, and lack of knowledge of their dynamics in response to the external inputs and internal biogeochemical reactions. In this study, we developed a modeling framework to address the sensitivity and uncertainty of CO2 and CH4 dynamics in the Brisbane River Estuary to both the riverine and wastewater inputs and biogeochemical reaction parameters. We showed that CO2 concentrations were most sensitive to catchment inputs and CH4 concentrations were most sensitive to the rate of sediment production and oxidation in the water. The estimated annual‐total CO2 equivalent emission from Brisbane River Estuary in 2016 was 3,514 ± 445 tonnes. The combination of targeted field campaigns with the modeling approach can help to improve carbon budgeting in estuaries, reduce uncertainty in emission estimates, and support management strategies to reduce or offset estuary greenhouse gas emissions.
