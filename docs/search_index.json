Nitrogen is of particular interest in that exists in many redox states and there are a myriad of organic and inorganic reactions that make up the nitrogen biogeochemical system. NO3- and NH4+ are the primary inorganic nutrients that re taken up by aquatic plants (phytoplankton and macrophytes) to build biomass as organic nitrogen. As nitrogen is a core building block of an aquatic ecosystem, aed_nitrogen (NIT) is designed as a low-level module for managing inorganic nitrogen pools, and is able to be linked to by higher order modules associated with primary production, and organic matter breakdown. The general nitrogen redox process specifically resolved in this module is NH4+ oxidation to NO3- by O2, and NO3- is reduced to N2 with organic matter, releasing organic nitrogen and NH4+ in the process. Advanced options are available, in which the end result is generation of the nitrogen species N2O. Producing N2O uses more variables and reaction pathways and is not necessary for most nutrient cycling studies. Importantly, nitrogen species react with organic matter. The description of organic matter involvement in nitrogen reactions and interactions can be found in Section (OM). The uptake and use of these variables by phytoplankton and macroalgae are described in Section (PHY) and (MAG). 9.3 Model Description - Default Model 9.3.1 Process Descriptions In the basic nitrogen module configuration, the variables NO3 and NH4 are included and able to be modified by nitrification, denitrification, sediment release and atmospheric deposition; to use this basic functionality, ensure the parameter simN2O is set to 0. The main balance equations for the simulated variables are summarised as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\partial{NO}_3}{\\partial t}=f_{nitrf} - f_{denit} + \\color{#394E73}{f_{atmdep}^{NOx}}+\\color{#8B701F}{f_{sed}^{NOx}} \\tag{9.1} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\partial{NH}_4}{\\partial t}=f_{denit} -f_{nitrf} + \\color{#394E73}{f_{atmdep}^{NH4}} + \\color{#8B701F}{f_{sed}^{NH4}} \\tag{9.2} \\end{equation}\\] 9.3.1.1 Nitrification-denitrification reactions In an environment of high O2, NH4+ is oxidized by oxygen to NO3- via nitrification. In an environment of low O2, NO3- is reduced to N2 via the process denitrification. O2 limitation on the rate of the reaction is not included in the default setup, but can be chosen by the user, as described in the section below. Figure 9.1: Summary of two main reactions in the default nitrogen model. 9.3.1.2 Nitrification The rate of nitrification is assumed to vary primarily due to temperature, and also due to variation in O2 and pH, according to: \\[\\begin{equation} f_{nitrf} =R_{nitrf}\\ \\ \\theta_{nitrif}^{T-20}\\ \\ {\\underbrace{\\Phi_{O2}^{nitrf}\\left[O_2\\right]\\ \\ \\Phi_{pH}^{nitrf}\\left[pH\\right]}_{\\text{Optional limitations}}}\\ \\ NH_4^+ \\tag{9.3} \\end{equation}\\] Where \\(\\theta_{nitrif}\\) is a Arrhenius temperature parameter specific to nitrification, and \\(T\\) is the temperature produced by the host model. O2 limitation on this rate will not be included in the setup unless a link to the oxygen module is made, as described in the section below. Oxygen limitation on nitrification: An extra option is to allow low O2 concentration to limit the nitrification rate, \\(f(O_{2})\\). If the aed2_oxygen module is linked to the nitrogen module, then this setting will switch on automatically. The limitation effect is calculated according to: \\[\\begin{equation} \\Phi_{O2}^{nitrf}\\left[O_2\\right]=\\ \\frac{O_2}{O_2+K_{nitrif}} \\tag{9.4} \\end{equation}\\] Where \\(K_{nitrif}\\) is a half saturation constant concentration of oxygen. The purpose of this factor is to reduce the rate of nitrification as oxygen moves below a critical concentration. pH limitation on nitrification: The rate of nitrification can be decreased at very high and low pH values, if pH is being simulated (see Carbon and Geochemsitry). To use this function, the parameter simNitrfpH is set to .TRUE.. Around neutral pH, between the upper and lower optimum parameters, the reaction proceeds at the normal rate. Below a lower tolerance, and above an upper tolerance, the reaction is stopped entirely. Between the optimum and tolerance values, the rate is limited, in proportion to pH. The piecewise function is described as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\Phi_{pH}^{nitrf}\\left[pH\\right]=\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} 0,\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ pH &lt; 0\\\\ 0,\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ x\\geq 0\\\\ 1,\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ x\\geq 0\\\\ 0,\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ x\\geq 0\\\\ 0,\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ pH\\geq 0\\\\ \\end{array} \\right. \\tag{9.5} \\end{equation}\\] The function is shown schematically in Figure 9.2. Figure 9.2: pH limitation on nitrification. Light limitation on nitrification: This process is not included in aed2 yet and it does not need to go on the website. 9.3.1.3 Denitrification Denitrification is a heterotrophic process occurring in low oxygen environments such as anoxic bottom waters and sediments. In addition to oxygen, the rate of denitrification depends on temperature and nitrate availability. It is calculated according to: \\[\\begin{equation} f_{denit} =R_{denit}\\ \\ \\theta_{denit}^{T-20}\\ \\ \\frac{NO_3^-}{NO_3^-+K_{NO3}}\\ \\ \\Phi_{O2}^{denit}\\left[O_2\\right]\\ \\ NO_3^- \\tag{9.6} \\end{equation}\\] Where \\(R_{denit}\\) is the kinetic rate constant for denitrification and \\(\\theta_{denit}\\) is a temperature parameter specific to denitrification. The Monod term in Equation /(???)(eqn:nitrogen6) 2 slows the rate at low NO3- concentrations, and allows it to proceed at the maximum rate R_denit at high NO3- concentrations. The parameter KNO3 is the half-saturation parameter for limiting the reaction rate and is set by the user to slow the rate at low NO3- concentrations. This parameter should not be confused with the O2 limitation factor K_denit, mentioned below; O2 limitation on the rate of the reaction is not included in the default setup, but can be chosen by the user, as described in the section below. Oxygen mediation of denitrification: For denitrification, oxygen slows the reaction through inclusion of an inhibition function as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\Phi_{O2}^{denit}\\left[O_2\\right]=\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} \\frac{K_{denit}}{O_{2}+K_{denit}},\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\Theta^{denit}_{oxylim} = 1\\\\ e^{(-O_{2}/K_{denit})},\\ \\ \\ \\Theta^{denit}_{oxylim} = 2\\\\ \\end{array} \\right. \\tag{9.7} \\end{equation}\\] Such that the denitrification rate is inhibited by high O2 concentrations, using the parameter K_denit. This parameter is an O2 concentration, and should not be confused with the parameter KNO3 which is a NO3- concentration. To use the process shown in Equation 4, the switch oxy_lim, \\(\\Theta_{oxylim}^{denit}\\), set to the number 1. Alternatively, the rate of denitrification can be set to decreases exponentially at high O2 concentrations, also using the parameter Kdenit. This is the same parameter as for the inhibition function described above, but applied differently. 9.3.1.4 Atmospheric deposition Nitrogen can be added to the surface cells of an aquatic system through two kinds of atmospheric deposition: wet and dry. These functions can be turned on by setting the parameters simDryDeposition and simWetDeposition to .TRUE.. \\[\\begin{equation} f_{atmdep}^{NOx}=\\left[{\\underbrace{F_{atm}^{DIN}}_{\\text{Dry flux}}}+{\\underbrace{R_n\\left[t\\right]\\ {DIN}_{atm}}_{\\text{Wet flux}}}\\right]\\frac{{\\ k}_{DINdepNO_x\\ }}{\\Delta z_{surf}} \\tag{9.8} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} f_{atmdep}^{NH_4}=\\left[{\\underbrace{F_{atm}^{DIN}}_{\\text{Dry flux}}}\\ +\\ {\\underbrace{R_n\\left[t\\right]\\ {DIN}_{atm}}_{\\text{Wet flux}}}\\right]\\frac{\\left({\\ 1-k}_{DINdepNO_x}\\right)}{\\Delta z_{surf}} \\tag{9.9} \\end{equation}\\] Where \\(\\Delta z_{surf}\\) is the surface layer thickness. Wet deposition adds nitrogen as a result of rain, \\(R_n\\) (m/day), which is a variable or a boundary condition provided as an environment variable from the host model. The deposition from rain is proportional to the atmospheric nitrogen concentration atm_din_conc. As with dry deposition, the proportion that is assigned to NOx and NH4+ is given by the same parameter f_dindep_nox. 9.3.1.5 Sediment flux NO3- and NH4+ can flux into the water column from the sediment, using the parameters \\(F_{sed}^{nit}\\) and \\(F_{sed}^{amm}\\), which set the maximum flux rate. The maximum flux rate is limited by temperature, using the parameters theta_sed_nit and theta_sed_amm, according to \\[\\begin{equation} f_{sed}^{NOx}=F_{sed}^{nit}\\ \\theta_{sednit}^{T-20\\ }\\Phi_{O2}^{nit}\\left[O_2\\right] \\tag{9.10} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} f_{sed}^{NH4}=F_{sed}^{amm}\\ \\theta_{sedamm}^{T-20\\ }\\Phi_{O2}^{amm}\\left[O_2\\right] \\tag{9.11} \\end{equation}\\] This assumes that there is a higher flux at higher temperatures. Oxygen mediation of the sediment nitrogen fluxes: As with the nitrification reaction, the sediment flux can be changed by bottom water O2 concentration. If the aed2_oxygen module is correctly linked to the nitrogen module then this setting will switch on automatically. At low O2 concentrations, the amount of NO3- fluxing out of the sediment is decreased and at high O2 concentrations, it is set close to the F_sed_nit, as shown in Equation 12. This is a convenient simplification that can be tuned within this module, rather than a more complicated full set of biogeochemical reactions. The parameter K_sed_nit can be used to tune the NO3- flux dependence on bottom water O2. A similar function can be used to tune the NH4+ flux using the parameter K_sed_amm, as shown in Equation 13. At high O2 concentrations, NH4+ flux decreases, and at low O2 concentrations, the flux is close to the parameter F_{sed}^{amm}. \\[\\begin{equation} \\Phi_{O2}^{nit}\\left[O_2\\right]=\\frac{O_2}{K_{sednit}+O_2} \\tag{9.12} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\Phi_{O2}^{amm}\\left[O_2\\right]=\\frac{K_{sed\\ amm}}{K_{sedamm}+O_2} \\tag{9.13} \\end{equation}\\] Advanced options: The approach described here is the most simple and default method for capturing DIN fluxes from the sediment, and is sometimes referred to the static model. This approach can be extended to allow for spatial variability in \\(F_{sed}^{nit}\\) and \\(F_{sed}^{amm}\\), by engaging the link to the aed_sedflux module, where the host models support multiple benthic cells or zones. In this case, users input spatially discrete values of \\(F_{sed}^{nit}\\) and \\(F_{sed}^{amm}\\). Where dynamic rates of DIN species are required to flux to/from the sediment (e.g. in response to episodic loading of organic material to the sediment, or for assessment of long-term changes in N loading), then the above expressions (Eq 10-13) are replaced instead with dynamically calculated variables in aed_seddiagenesis, via a link created with the aed2_sedflux module. 9.3.2 Variable Summary The default variables created by this module, and the optionally required linked variables needed for full functionality of this module are summarised in Table X. 9.3.3 Parameter Summary The default parameters and settings used by this module are summarised in Table X. 9.3.4 Optional Module Links 9.3.5 Feedbacks to the Host Model 9.4 Model Description - Adding N2O Reactions The basic function of the nitrogen model is described above, when the parameter simN2O is set to the number 0. Users may extend their model to simulate the N cycle in more detail, including resolution of intermediate N pools. Using these advanced options, there are extra reaction pathways that are not critical for resolving basic nutrient cycling processes, but are needed for calculating the concentration of the greenhouse gas N2O. Here, these advanced module options are outlined, for when the user sets the parameter simN2O to the number 1 or 2. Simulation option 1 includes N2O, using a relatively simplistic assumption that N2O passively “leaks out” as a by-product or is consumed during the traditional nitrification-denitrification reactions. Simulation option 2 is a more comprehensive biogeochemical depiction of N cycling between its different redox states and considering the full diversity of autotrophic and heterotrophic pathways. In addition to different N reaction pathways in these sub-models, the inclusion of additional inorganic N components is also accompanied by new process pathways for atmospheric exchange and sediment interaction. 9.4.1 Process Descriptions (simN20 = 1) The simN2O 1 option is based on the conceptual model from Babbin et al. or Nevison. If the parameter simN2O is set to the number 1, N2O is both created and consumed through the denitrification reaction, and produced during nitrification; these rates are oxygen dependent. The main balance equation for the additional N2O is summarised as: 9.5 Setup &amp; Configuration 9.6 Case Studies &amp; Examples 9.6.1 Case Study 9.6.2 Publications "]]
