Other processes impacting the oxygen concentration include the breakdown of DOC by aerobic heterotrophic bacteria to CO2, whereby a stoichiometrically equivalent amount of oxygen is removed. Chemical oxidation, for example processes such as nitrification or sulfide oxidation, also consume oxygen dependent on the relevant stoichiometric factor. Photosynthetic oxygen production and respiratory oxygen consumption by pelagic phytoplankton is also included and is summed over the number of simulated phytoplankton groups. Seagrass interaction with the oxygen cycle is configurable within the model. 7.3 Model Description 7.3.1 Process Descriptions Oxygen Solubility &amp; Atmospheric Exchange Atmospheric exchange is typically modelled based on Wanninkhof (1992) and the flux equation of Riley and Skirrow (1974) for the open water, and on Ho et al.

["phytoplankton.html", "13 Phytoplankton 13.1 Contributors 13.2 Overview 13.3 Model Description 13.4 Setup &amp; Configuration 13.5 Case Studies &amp; Examples", " 13 Phytoplankton 13.1 Contributors 13.2 Overview The approach to simulate algal biomass is to adopt several plankton functional types (PFTs) that are typically defined based on specific groups such as diatoms, dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria. Whilst each group that is simulated is unique, they share a common mathematical approach and each simulate growth, death and sedimentation processes, and customisable internal nitrogen, phosphorus and/or silica stores if desired. Distinction between groups is made by adoption of groups specific parameters for environmental dependencies, and/or enabling options such as vertical migration or N fixation. For each phytoplankton group, the maximum potential growth rate at 20°C is multiplied by the minimum value of expressions for limitation by light, phosphorus, nitrogen and silica (when configured). While there may be some interaction between limiting factors, a minimum expression is likely to provide a realistic representation of growth limitation (Rhee and Gotham, 1981). 13.3 Model Description 13.3.1 Process Descriptions Photosynthesis &amp; Nutrient Uptake For each phytoplankton group, the maximum potential growth rate at 20˚C is multiplied by the minimum value of expressions for limitation by light, phosphorus, nitrogen and silica (when configured). While there may be some interaction between limiting factors, a minimum expression is likely to provide a realistic representation of growth limitation (Rhee and Gotham, 1981). Therefore, photosynthesis is parameterized as the uptake of carbon, and depends on the temperature, light and nutrient dimensionless functions (adopted from Hipsey &amp; Hamilton, 2008; Li et al., 2013). \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{Mass Balance Equation} \\tag{13.1} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{align} {f_{uptake}^{PHY_{Ca}}} &amp;= \\end{align}\\] \\[\\begin{align} \\underbrace{{R_{growth}^{PHY_{a}}}}_{\\text{Max growth rate at 20˚C}}*\\underbrace{(1-{k_{pr}^{PHY_{a}}})}_{\\text{Photorespiratory loss}}*\\underbrace{{\\Phi_{tem}^{PHY_{a}}}(T)}_{\\text{Temperature scaling}}*\\underbrace{{\\Phi_{str}^{PHY_{a}}}(T)}_{\\text{Metabolic stress}}* \\end{align}\\] \\[\\begin{align} &amp;{\\text{min}}\\begin{Bmatrix}\\underbrace{\\Phi_{light}^{PHY_{a}}(I)}_{\\text{Light limitation}},\\underbrace{\\Phi_{N}^{PHY_{a}}(NO_{3},NH_{4},PHY_{N_{a}})}_{\\text{N limitation}},\\underbrace{\\Phi_{P}^{PHY_{a}}(PO_{4},PHY_{P_{a}})}_{\\text{P limitation}},\\underbrace{\\Phi_{Si}^{PHY_{a}}(RSi)}_{\\text{Si limitation}}\\end{Bmatrix}* \\end{align}\\] \\[\\begin{align} [PHY_{C_{a}}] \\end{align}\\] To allow for reduced growth at non-optimal temperatures, a temperature function is used where the maximum productivity occurs at a temperature \\(T_{OPT}\\); above this productivity decreases to zero at the maximum allowable temperature, \\(T_{MAX}\\). Below the standard temperature, \\(T_{STD}\\) the productivity follows a simple Arrenhius scaling formulation. In order to fit a function with these restrictions the following conditions are assumed: at \\(T=T_{STD}\\),\\(\\ {\\ \\Phi}_{tem}\\left(T\\right)=1\\) and at \\(T=T_{OPT},\\ \\ \\frac{d\\Phi_{tem}\\left(T\\right)}{dT}=0\\), and at \\(T=T_{MAX}\\),\\(\\ \\Phi_{tem}\\left(T\\right)=0\\). This can be numerically solved using Newton’s iterative method and can be specific for each phytoplankton group. The temperature function is calculated according to (Griffin et al. 2001): \\[\\begin{equation} \\Phi_{tem}^{{PHY}_a}\\left(T\\right)=\\vartheta_a^{T-20}-\\vartheta_a^{k\\left[T-{c1}_a\\right]}+{c0}_a \\tag{13.2} \\end{equation}\\] Where \\({c1}_a\\) and \\({c0}_a\\) are solved numerically given input values of: \\(T_a^{std}\\), \\(T_a^{opt}\\) and \\(T_a^{max}\\). The level of light limitation on phytoplankton growth can be modelled as photoinhibition or non-photoinhibition. In the absence of significant photoinhibition, Webb et al. (1974) suggested a relationship for the fractional limitation of the maximum potential rate of carbon fixation for the case where light saturation behavior was absent (Talling, 1957), and the equations can be analytically integrated with respect to depth (Hipsey and Hamilton, 2008). For the case of photoinhibition, the light saturation value of maximum production (IS) is used and the net level effect can be averaged over the cell by integrating over depth. The aed_phytoplankton module contains several light functions, including those from a recent review by Baklouti et al. (2006). The user must select the sensitivity to light according to a photosynthesis-irradiance (P-I curve) formulation and each species must be set to be either non-photoinhibited or photoinhibited according to the options in Table 9. Table Limitation of the photosynthetic rate may be dampened according to nitrogen or phosphorus availability, and this is either approximated using a Monod expression of the static model is chosen, or based on the internal nutrient stoichiometry if the dynamic (Droop uptake) model is selected: For advanced users, an optional metabolic scaling factor can be included to reduce the photosynthetic capacity of the simulated organisms, for example due to metabolic stress due to undertaking N2 fixation: \\[\\begin{equation} \\Phi_{str}^{{PHY}_a}=\\underbrace{f_{NF}^{{PHY}_a}+\\left[{1-f}_{NF}^{{PHY}_a}\\right]\\Phi_N^{{PHY}_a}\\left({NO}_3,{NH}_4,{PHY_N}_a\\right)}_{N_{2}\\text{ fixation growth scaling}} \\tag{13.3} \\end{equation}\\] The above discussion relates to photosynthesis and carbon uptake by the phytoplankton community. In addition users must choose one of two options to model the P, N uptake dynamics for each algal group: a constant nutrient to carbon ratio, or dynamic intracellular stores. For the first model a simple Michaelis-Menten equation is used to model nutrient limitation with a half-saturation constant for the effect of external nutrient concentrations on the growth rate. The internal phosphorus and nitrogen dynamics within the phytoplankton groups can be modelled using dynamic intracellular stores that are able to regulate growth based on the model of Droop (1974). This model allows for the phytoplankton to have dynamic nutrient uptake rates with variable internal nutrient concentrations bounded by user-defined minimum and maximum values (e.g., see Li et al., 2013). Table The uptake of nitrogen must be partitioned into uptake of NO3, NH4 and potentially labile DON. In the present version, distinction between uptake of NO3 and NH4 is calculated automatically via a preference factor: \\[\\begin{equation} {\\ p}_{NH4}^{{PHY}_a}=\\frac{{NO}_3\\ {NH}_4}{\\left({NH}_4+K_N^{{PHY}_a}\\right)\\left({NO}_3+K_N^{{PHY}_a}\\right)}\\frac{{NH}_4{\\ K}_N^{{PHY}_a}}{\\left({NH}_4+{NO}_3\\right)\\left({NO}_3+K_N^{{PHY}_a}\\right)} \\tag{13.4} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} p_{NO3}^{{PHY}_a}=1-{\\ p}_{NH4}^{{PHY}_a} \\tag{13.5} \\end{equation}\\] For diatom groups, silica processes are simulated that include uptake of dissolved silica. The silica limitation function for diatoms is similar to the constant cases for nitrogen and phosphorus which assumes a fixed C:Si ratio. Respiration, Excretion &amp; Mortality Metabolic loss of nutrients from mortality and excretion is proportional to the internal nitrogen to chla ratio multiplied by the loss rate and the fraction of excretion and mortality that returns to the detrital pool. Loss terms for respiration, natural mortality and excretion are modelled with a single ‘respiration’ rate coefficient. This loss rate is then divided into the pure respiratory fraction and losses due to mortality and excretion. The constant \\(f_{DOM}\\) is the fraction of mortality and excretion to the dissolved organic pool with the remainder into the particulate organic pool. Nutrient losses through mortality and excretion for the internal nutrient model are similar to the simple model described above, except that dynamically calculated internal nutrient concentrations are used. \\[\\begin{align*} \\hat{R}&amp;=R_{resp}^{{PHY}_a}\\ \\ \\Phi_{sal}^{{PHY}_a}\\left(S\\right)\\ \\ \\left(\\vartheta_{resp}^{{PHY}_a}\\right)^{T-20} \\tag{13.6}\\\\ f_{resp}^{{PHY_C}_a}&amp;=k_{fres}^{{PHY}_a}\\ \\hat{R}\\ \\left[{PHY_C}_a\\right] \\tag{13.7}\\\\ f_{excr}^{{PHY_C}_a}&amp;=\\left(1-k_{fres}^{{PHY}_a}\\right)\\ k_{fdom}^{{PHY}_a}\\ \\hat{R}\\ \\ \\left[{PHY_C}_a\\right] \\tag{13.8}\\\\ f_{mort}^{{PHY_C}_a}&amp;=\\left(1-k_{fres}^{{PHY}_a}\\right)\\ \\left({1-k}_{fdom}^{{PHY}_a}\\right)\\ \\hat{R}\\ \\left[{PHY_C}_a\\right] \\tag{13.9}\\\\ f_{excr}^{{PHY_N}_a}&amp;=k_{fdom}^{{PHY}_a}\\ \\hat{R}\\ \\left[{PHY_N}_a\\right] \\tag{13.10}\\\\ f_{mort}^{{PHY_N}_a}&amp;=\\left(1-k_{fdom}^{{PHY}_a}\\right)\\ \\hat{R}\\ \\left[{PHY_N}_a\\right] \\tag{13.11}\\\\ f_{excr}^{{PHY_P}_a}&amp;=k_{fdom}^{{PHY}_a}\\ \\hat{R}\\ \\left[{PHY_P}_a\\right] \\tag{13.12}\\\\ f_{mort}^{{PHY_P}_a}&amp;=\\left(1-k_{fdom}^{{PHY}_a}\\right)\\ \\hat{R}\\ \\ \\left[{PHY_P}_a\\right] \\tag{13.13}\\\\ f_{excr}^{{PHY_{Si}}_a}&amp;=\\hat{R}\\ \\left[{PHY_{Si}}_a\\right] \\tag{13.14} \\end{align*}\\] The salinity effect on mortality is given by various quadratic formulations, depending on the groups sensitivity to salinity (Griffin et al 2001; Robson and Hamilton, 2004).

The module includes an advanced solver, and provides pH and other solution properties, and optional mineral or gas phases. Relevant kinetic transformations (e.g. redox reactions) between simulated components are also included. Metals may be simulated as part of the model and can also be active within the biological cycles. The module is flexible and simple in its configuration and can be used in the water column and in the sediment if the dynamic sediment diagenesis model (see Section ?) is also being simulated. The module dynamically links with the other biogeochemical processes within AED2, such that any biological activity (e.g. algal nutrient uptake and photosynthesis, microbial respiration, and nitrification) will dynamically affect the aqueous speciation and pH. Details of the equilibrium and non-equilibrium processes included are described in the adjacent tab. Figure 16.1: Conceptual diagram highlighting key variables and interactions within the model 16.3 Model Description 16.3.1 Process Descriptions 16.3.1.1 General Approach The aqueous geochemistry sub-model was developed to simulate aqueous speciation and solubility equilibrium control of pure-phase minerals using an approach similar to PHREEQC and as reported previously in Salmon et al (in review). Each dissolved component, \\(X\\), and mineral phase, \\(PP\\), is a state variable within the model and is mass-conserved. In addition to external loading from inflows, the model includes a configurable dissolved sediment flux term for the dissolved species and a sedimentation term for the particulates. If we remove the hydrodynamic terms (e.g., inflows/outflows, mixing) for brevity, the differential equation is defined for the dissolved state variables as: Aqueous Speciation &amp; Solubility Equilibrium Control The aqueous geochemistry model is conceptually similar to other equilbrium codes (e.g. … ). The model defines geochemical reactions in terms of components. An aqueous species \\(C\\) is created as a product of reaction between components \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), as shown in the following example: \\[\\begin{equation} aA + bB \\Longleftrightarrow cC \\tag{16.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(a\\), \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) are the stoichiometric coefficients. The reaction shown above is able to proceed back and forward depending on the prevailing conditions of the aqueous solution. The equilibrium of the reaction is a function of the standard free energy, and from this the familiar mass-action expression is defined: \\[\\begin{equation} K_C=\\frac{[C]^c}{[A]^a[B]^b} \\tag{16.2} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(K_{C}\\) is denoted the equilibrium constant. In any natural aquatic system, numerous components are present and there are therefore hundreds of reactions similar to Eq. above that will be close to equilibrium. The many reactions form a complex and interdependent set of simultaneous expressions which can be solved numerically, discussed next. For each component, \\(X_{x}\\), (generally components are equivalent to elements, except for the case of elements with multiple redox states, in which case each redox state is assigned as a unique component), a set of \\(M\\) components is defined, \\(X \\in \\{X_1, X_2, ..., X_M\\}\\). Combination of all the components into an aqueous solution results in numerous reactions taking place of the form of Eq. .., and we define the resultant set of aqueous species that result as: \\(C \\in \\{C_1, C_2 ..., C_N\\}\\), where \\(N\\) is the total number produced. The `activity’ of an aqueous species is not equivalent to its molality due to the nonideality of aqueous solutions; a species activity, is related to its molality according to the activity coefficient, : \\[\\begin{equation} [C_i] = \\tilde{C_i} = \\gamma_i C_i \\tag{16.3} \\end{equation}\\] Numerous methods exist for estimating a species activity coefficient. The first is known as the Davies equation: \\[\\begin{equation} \\log \\gamma_i = -c_1z_i^2\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{\\mu}}{1+\\sqrt{\\mu}}-0.3\\mu \\right) \\tag{16.4} \\end{equation}\\] and the other one used in the AED2 solution is the Debye-Huckel equation: \\[\\begin{equation} \\log \\gamma_i = -\\frac{c_1z_i^2\\sqrt{\\mu}}{1+c_2c_3\\sqrt{\\mu}} +c_4\\mu \\tag{16.5} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(z_{i}\\) is the ionic charge of the \\(i^{\\text{th}}\\) species \\(c_{1-4}\\) are constants that depend upon properties such as the temperature of the solution. The activity of a species is dependent on the ionic strength, \\(\\mu\\), a solution property defined as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\mu = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_i^N{z_i^2\\frac{C_i}{W_{aq}}} \\tag{16.6} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(W_{aq}\\) is mass of water in the aqueous phase. To numerically solve the system of equations, the total number of moles of any component is estimated by adding up the amount contained in each species: \\[\\begin{equation} T_j = \\sum_{i=1}^N{a_{ij}C_i} \\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\: j=1..M \\tag{16.7} \\end{equation}\\] where \\())aix\\) is the stoichiometric coefficient of component \\(x\\) in species \\(i\\). The activity of each species is calculated using the mass-action equations, which are defined more generically as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\tilde{C}_i = K_i \\prod_{j=1}^M{\\tilde{X}_j^{a_{ij}}} \\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\: j=1..N \\tag{16.8} \\end{equation}\\] Taking the logarithm of both sides of Equation above leaves: \\[\\begin{equation} log \\tilde{C}_i = \\log K_i + \\sum_{j=1}^M{a_{ij}\\log \\tilde{X}_j} \\:\\:\\:\\:\\: j=1..N \\tag{16.9} \\end{equation}\\] which can be defined in matrix notation as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\tilde{C}^* = K^*+A\\tilde{X}^* \\tag{16.10} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(*\\) denotes a vector quantity. The solution is achieved by iterating using a Newton-Rhapson scheme, which aims to minimize the residual, \\(R\\), between the estimated component molalities (\\(T\\)) and the known values: \\[\\begin{equation} R_x = \\sum_{i=1}^{N}{a_{ix}C_i-T_x}\\:\\:\\:\\:\\: i=1..N \\tag{16.11} \\end{equation}\\] In matrix notation: \\[\\begin{equation} R=A^{-1}C-T \\tag{16.12} \\end{equation}\\] The Newton-Rhapson technique iterates towards a solution by employing a derivative (termed Jacobian) matrix, \\(J\\): \\[\\begin{equation} R=J \\Delta X \\tag{16.13} \\end{equation}\\] which is solved for \\(\\Delta X\\) at each iteration. The new estimates for \\(X\\) are then updated according to: \\[\\begin{equation} X^{n+1} = X^n + \\Delta X \\tag{16.14} \\end{equation}\\] and the whole scheme proceeds until the solution has sufficiently converged, \\(R&lt;\\epsilon\\), where \\(\\epsilon\\) is a pre-defined convergence criterion (\\(10^{-10}\\) in this code). The Jacobian matrix is defined as: \\[\\begin{equation} J = \\frac{dR_x}{dX_k} \\tag{16.15} \\end{equation}\\] which can be expanded to: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{dR_x}{dX_k} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N}{a_{ik}}\\frac{dC_i}{dX_k}-\\frac{dT_x}{dX_k} \\tag{16.16} \\end{equation}\\] using Eq. …. The derivatives are then defined according to: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{dC_i}{dX_k} = a_{ik}\\frac{C_i}{X_k} \\tag{16.17} \\end{equation}\\] and \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{dT_x}{dX_k} = 0 \\tag{16.18} \\end{equation}\\] which are the substituted into Eq. .. to leave \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{dR_x}{dX_k} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N}{a_{ik}\\:a_{ik}}\\frac{C_i}{X_k}. \\tag{16.19} \\end{equation}\\] Therefore for a given total number of moles of each element in each computational cell, using this scheme the model solves for the activity of each aqueous species, ionic strength and \\(pH\\). The charge balance variable (denoted \\(ubalchg\\)) is also subject to advection and mixing as all other state variables, and importantly, an estimate of \\(ubalchg\\) must be provided at any inflow boundaries. If this is not done, then the charge balance will be compromised, and will manifest in a poor \\(pH\\) prediction. The Newton-Rhapson scheme described above is implemented by making use of the Simplex numerical solver (Barrodale and Roberts, 1980; Parkhurst and Appelo, 1999). This is because AED2 also allows for simulation of pure phase (i.e. non-aqueous phase) minerals. When minerals can precipitate and dissolve, properties such as the ionic strength (\\(MU\\)), activity of water (\\(XH_{2}O\\)) and charge balance (\\(CV\\)) may be non-conservative in the aqueous solution. These are therefore included as unknowns in the simplex solver, which uses the Newton-Rhapson technique to solve the following matrix: \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{array}{lll} \\begin{pmatrix} R_{PP}\\\\ R_{X_{1}}\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ R_{X_{N}}\\\\ R_{MU}\\\\ R_{H_2O}\\\\ R_{CB}\\\\ R_{W_{aq}}\\\\ X_{PP}\\\\ \\end{pmatrix} =&amp; \\begin{pmatrix} \\pd{R_{PP}}{\\text{ln}(\\tilde{X}_1)} &amp; \\dots &amp; \\pd{R_{PP}}{\\text{ln}(\\tilde{X}_N)} &amp; \\pd{R_{PP}}{d\\mu} &amp; &amp; \\\\ \\pd{R_{X_1}}{\\text{ln}(\\tilde{X}_1)} &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \\\\ &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \\\\ \\vdots &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \\\\ &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \\\\ &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \\pd{R_{Waq}}{X_{PP}} \\\\ &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; 1 \\\\ \\end{pmatrix} &amp; \\begin{pmatrix} d\\text{ln}(\\tilde{X}_1)\\\\ R_{X_{1}}\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ d\\text{ln}(\\tilde{X}_N)\\\\ d\\mu \\\\ d\\text{ln}(\\tilde{X}_{H_2O})\\\\ d\\text{ln}(\\tilde{X}_{H^+})\\\\ d\\text{ln}(W_{aq})\\\\ dX_{PP}\\\\ \\end{pmatrix} \\end{array} \\tag{16.20} \\end{equation}\\] The operation of the simplex solver is complicated and the reader is referred to Barrodale and Roberts (1980) for a detailed account. The aqueous species used in the simulations is based on those from Nordstrom et al. (1990), termed the WATEQ4F database.

Over the past decade several advances have been made for the simulating organism dynamics using coupled hydrodynamic-organism fate models. These have generally been used for simulating coliform bacteria (Hipsey, Antenucci, and Brookes 2008), with applications also reported for Cryptosporidium (Hipsey et al. 2004) and viruses (Sokolova et al. 2012) . In general, these models simulate organism concentrations within water bodies by accounting for external loading, advection and mixing process that occur within the lake interior, organism inactivation and sedimentation. The purpose of this document is to firstly synthesize relevant information from empirical and prior modelling studies to justify the necessary model required for reservoir systems, and secondly to summarise the implementation of the pathogen module within the AED2 model framework. 17.3 Model Description 17.3.1 Process Descriptions General Approach The general balance equation for organism transport and fate is summarized in Hipsey, Antenucci, and Brookes (2008) as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{dC}{dt} = -\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x_{j}}(CU_{j})+\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x_{j}}(\\kappa_{j}\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x_{j}}) +C_{in}-C_{out}+C_{r}(\\tau,SS_{SED},C_{SED})\\\\ +[k_{g}(T,S,DOC_{L})-k_{d}(T,S,pH)-k_{l} (I_{0},S,DO,pH)-k_{s}(T,S,SS)-k_{p}(T)]C \\tag{17.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(C\\) is the organic concentration (orgs m-3), \\(t\\) is time, \\(x_j\\) is the distance in the \\(j\\)-th dimension (m), \\(U_j\\) is the velocity in the \\(j\\)-th dimension (ms-1), is the eddy-diffusivity and \\(C_{in}\\) and \\(C_{out}\\) are the inflow and outflow fluxes respectively (orgs m-3s-1). This relates organism concentration through time to hydrodynamic characteristics within the lake (as captured by \\(U\\), \\(\\kappa\\) and \\(\\tau\\)), and the environmental conditions experienced that influence organism fate (including temperature, salinity, light intensity, dissolved organic carbon, oxygen and pH). This comprehensive description is usually simplified for specific applications, based on justification of the dominant processes present in any particular lake and available data for model setup and validation. Within the TUFLOWFV-AED2 model framework, the 1st three terms on the RHS are solved via the finite volume scalar transport routines with TUFLOW-FV and the fourth and fifth terms are simulated by the aed2_pathogens module of the AED2 aquatic ecological modelling library. For this application the growth and predation terms suggested by Hipsey, Antenucci, and Brookes (2008) are not considered directly since the likelihood of growth is small (Sidhu and Toze 2012) and predation/grazing is factored into the die-off rate (described below). The remaining terms for simulation of organism resuspension and inactivation are described in detail next. Natural Mortality Natural mortality, or the ‘dark-death rate’, \\(k_d\\), is an important process determining the net rate of die off of protozoan, viral and bacterial organisms and has been reported to vary for specific organisms due to changes in temperature, salinity and pH. The reported die off rates in the literature however are widely variable, with a synthesis of numerous studies from a range of water bodies presented in Hipsey, Antenucci, and Brookes (2008). For freshwater reservoirs, changes in salinity and pH are unlikely to be a significant driver of organism viability relative to the range presented Hipsey, Antenucci, and Brookes (2008) and therefore a simple constant die-off rate that depends on temperature is appropriate: \\[\\begin{equation} k_{d}(T) = k_{d_{20}}\\vartheta _{M}^{T-20} \\tag{17.2} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(k_{d_{20}}\\) is the rate of mortality in the dark at 20C and in freshwater. Since the AED2 implementation of the model to be applied with NPD does not include protozoan grazing as a separate term (as in Eq 1), the grazing effect needs to be embodied within the \\(k_{d_{20}}\\) term. This effectively assumes a constant grazing pressure over time, and if chosen to be a low value this will essentially ensure conservative estimate of the die-off due to grazing. Empirical data from Wivenhoe dam shows the presence of native micro-organisms can increase the background die-off rate by 1.1-3.0x (eg Table 5 in Sidhu and Toze (2012)). Sunlight Inactivation Depending on the clarity of the water, the light climate of the lake can be a dominant factor influencing organism viability and this has been observed empirically in Wivenhoe Dam by Sidhu and Toze (2012). Different organism types experience different sensitivity to different light bandwidths, with most organisms sensitive to UV-B and UV-A and some sensitive to light in the visible spectrum (Sinton, Hall, and Braithwaite 2007). Hipsey, Antenucci, and Brookes (2008) formulated a multiple band-width model for organisms that included direct and indirect mechanisms for sunlight mediated inactivation by accounting for the effect of salinity, oxygen and pH on free radical formation. Here we use a simplified form that accounts only for direct sunlight denaturation as the indirect mechanism is more specific to MS2 phage relative to rotavirus for example (Verbyla and Mihelcic 2015). The implemented expression is therefore: \\[\\begin{equation} k_{l} = \\sum_{b=1}^{N_{b}}[\\varphi k_{b} I_{b}] \\tag{17.3} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(N_B\\) is the number of discrete solar bandwidths to be modeled, \\(b\\) is the bandwidth class {1, 2, … , \\(N_B\\)}, \\(k_b\\) is the freshwater inactivation rate coefficient for exposure to the \\(b^{th}\\) class (m2 MJ-1), \\(I_b\\) is the intensity of the \\(b^{th}\\) bandwidth class (Wm-2), \\(\\varphi\\) is a constant to convert units from seconds to days and J to MJ (= 8.64*10-2). In AED2, the light intensity is computed for 3 distinct bandwidths, including UV-B, UV-A and PAR, and the attenuation of each through the reservoir water column is based on bandwidth specific light extinction coefficients, that account for the effect of turbidity and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) on attenutation. Sedimentation Sedimentation of organisms occurs at a rate depending on the degree to which the population is attached to suspended particles. Within AED2, this is captured by simulating free and attached organisms and multiple groups of particles may be accounted for. If we assume a single dominant particle size and ignore the effect of salinity on the settling velocity, then the expression in Hipsey, Antenucci, and Brookes (2008) for the effective sedimentation velocity reduces to: \\[\\begin{equation} k_{s}=(1-f_{a})\\frac{V_{c}}{\\Delta z}+f_{a}\\frac{V_{s}}{\\Delta z} \\tag{17.4} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(f_a\\) is the attached fraction, and \\(V\\) is the vertical velocity of organisms or sediment particles. Resupension Resuspension of organisms accumulated within the sediment has been show to be a relatively important terms in environments where high currents or waves exist. In reservoirs this can occur in the lake margins or deeper in the lake where internal waves or river underflows increase the shear stress at the sediment. The amount of organisms that resuspend depends not only on the shear stress but also n the concentration of organisms in the surficial layers of the sediment. This may be modelled by accounting for the deposited organisms, decay within the sediment and resuspension rate, however, this is notoriously difficult given potentially complex dynamics of organisms in the sediment. Instead we assume that a standard background concentration exists within different sediment regions (based on depth and local geomorphology) and simulate resuspension rate as: \\[\\begin{equation} C_{r}(\\tau)=\\alpha_{c}\\frac{(\\tau - \\tau_{c_{s}})}{\\tau _{ref}}\\frac{1}{\\Delta z_{bot}} \\tag{17.5} \\end{equation}\\] where, \\(\\alpha_C\\) is the rate of organism suspension (orgs m-2s-1), which occurs when the critical shear stress is exceeded in the relative computational cell. 17.3.2 Variable Summary State Variables Table 17.1: State variables Variable Name Description Units Variable Type Core/Optional PTH_name Concentration of pathogens cfu/100mL Pelagic Optional Diagnostics 17.3.3 Parameter Summary Table 17.2: Diagnostics p_name ‘crypto’ ‘ecoli’ ‘totalcoli’ string pathogen name coef_grwth_uMAX 0.00e+00 3.00e+00 2.40e+00 real Max growth rate at 20C coef_grwth_Tmin 4.00e+00 4.00e+00 4.00e+00 real Tmin and Tmax f(T) coef_grwth_Tmax 3.50e+01 3.50e+01 3.50e+01 real Tmin and Tmax ? coef_grwth_T1 8.00e-03 8.00e-03 8.00e-03 real coef_grwth_T1 and coef_grwth_T2 coef_grwth_T2 1.00e-01 1.00e-01 1.00e-01 real coef_grwth_T1 and coef_grwth_T2 coef_grwth_Kdoc 0.00e+00 3.00e-01 3.00e-01 real Half-saturation for growth coef_grwth_Kdoc coef_grwth_ic 0.00e+00 0.00e+00 0.00e+00 real coef_grwth_ic coef_mort_kd20 3.00e-02 4.80e-01 3.40e-01 real Mortality rate (Dark death rate) @ 20C and 0 psu coef_mort_theta 1.08e+00 1.08e+00 1.11e+00 real Temperature multiplier for mortality: coef_mort_theta coef_mort_c_SM 0.00e+00 0.00e+00 2.00e-07 real Salinity effect on mortality coef_mort_alpha 0.00e+00 6.10e+00 4.20e+00 real Salinity effect on mortality coef_mort_beta 0.00e+00 2.50e-01 2.50e-01 real Salinity effect on mortality coef_mort_c_PHM 0.00e+00 5.00e+01 5.00e+01 real pH effect on mortality coef_mort_K_PHM 0.00e+00 6.00e+00 6.00e+00 real pH effect on mortality coef_mort_delta_M 0.00e+00 4.00e+00 4.00e+00 real pH effect on mortality coef_mort_fdoc 0.00e+00 5.00e-01 5.00e-01 real Fraction of mortality back to doc coef_light_kb_vis 0.00e+00 9.70e-02 9.70e-02 real Light inactivation coef_light_kb_uva 0.00e+00 1.16e+00 1.16e+00 real Light inactivation coef_light_kb_uvb 0.00e+00 3.64e+01 3.64e+01 real Light inactivation coef_light_cSb_vis 6.70e-03 6.70e-03 6.70e-03 real Salinity effect on light inactivation coef_light_cSb_uva 6.70e-03 6.70e-03 6.70e-03 real Salinity effect on light inactivation coef_light_cSb_uvb 6.70e-03 6.70e-03 6.70e-03 real Salinity effect on light inactivation coef_light_kDOb_vis 5.00e-01 5.00e-01 5.00e-01 real DO effect on light coef_light_kDOb_uva 5.00e-01 5.00e-01 5.00e-01 real DO effect on light coef_light_kDOb_uvb 5.00e-01 5.00e-01 5.00e-01 real DO effect on light coef_light_cpHb_vis 1.00e+01 1.00e+01 1.00e+01 real pH effect on light inactivation coef_light_cpHb_uva 1.00e+01 1.00e+01 1.00e+01 real pH effect on light inactivation coef_light_cpHb_uvb 1.00e+01 1.00e+01 1.00e+01 real pH effect on light inactivation coef_light_KpHb_vis 5.00e+00 5.00e+00 5.00e+00 real pH effect on light inactivation coef_light_KpHb_uva 5.00e+00 5.00e+00 5.00e+00 real pH effect on light inactivation coef_light_KpHb_uvb 5.00e+00 5.00e+00 5.00e+00 real pH effect on light inactivation coef_light_delb_vis 3.00e+00 3.00e+00 3.00e+00 real exponent for pH effect on light inactivation coef_light_delb_uva 3.00e+00 3.00e+00 3.00e+00 real exponent for pH effect on light inactivation coef_light_delb_uvb 3.00e+00 3.00e+00 3.00e+00 real exponent for pH effect on light inactivation coef_pred_kp20 0.00e+00 2.00e-01 2.00e-01 real Loss rate due to predation and temp multiplier coef_pred_theta_P 1.00e+00 1.04e+00 1.04e+00 real Loss rate due to predation and temp multiplier coef_sett_fa 0.00e+00 9.40e-01 8.10e-01 real Attached fraction in water column coef_sett_w_path -2.50e-06 -5.00e-07 -5.00e-07 real Sedimentation velocity (m/d) at 20C (-ve means down) for NON-ATTACHED orgs coef_resus_epsilonP 1.00e-02 1.00e-02 1.00e-02 real Pathogen resuspension rate coef_resus_tauP_0 1.00e-02 1.00e-02 1.00e-02 real Critical shear stress for organism resuspension 17.3.4 Optional Module Links 17.3.5 Feedbacks to the Host Model 17.4 Setup &amp; Configuration 17.4.1 Setup Example Table 17.3: Parameters and configuration Parameter Name Description Units Parameter Type Default Typical Range Comment num_pathogens number of pathogens to model 1-?

The meta-analysis by Paraska et al (2014) discussed the history of their evolution to these complex configurations, in which the original models of Boudreau (1996), Van Cappellen and Wang (1996) and Soetaert et al. (1996) were taken up and applied in many contexts by new modellers, who added new features and extended their capabilities, or discarded old features as required. The meta-analysis also identified the major challenges associated with developing new sediment diagenesis models. Here, a new modelling package for sediment biogeochemistry is presented, CANDI-AED, which is an extension of the Approach 1 models, but reengineered and augmented with new model approaches and capabilities as a way to address some of these challenges. Paraska et al (in prep) outlined the significance and uncertainty associated with different parameterisation approaches of organic matter dynamics. In these cases, simulations were run to test the significance of different theoretical approaches and model structural assumptions, using an idealised model setup with only primary oxidation reactions and no physical processes or spatial resolution. The true impact of these different model approaches within a spatially-resolved model, accounting for all of the advection, diffusion and secondary reaction processes, however, is yet to be determined and it is unclear whether some formulations may suit some application contexts better than others. Therefore there is a need for a fully flexible model structure that can include these different organic matter breakdown parameterisations and allow users to assess critically the alternative approaches. In addition, other aspects related to secondary redox reactions, mineral reactions, precipitation and adsorption should similarly be subject to comparative assessments. A further challenge identified in Paraska et al (2014) was the difficulty involved in taking up these models by the broader modelling community, because of problems related to connecting these complex model structures with other water quality and aquatic ecosystem models. For example, there are problems related to mapping variables of ecosystem models to those of diagenesis models. There are also problems related to the mismatch between the resolution of processes that occur over different spatial and temporal scales, for example fast equilibrium reactions between sediment layers, and seasonal temperature or salinity changes across a study site. The model developed as part of this research aimed to address these challenges by building a full-featured, open-source model code with the flexibility to do the following: - set different kinetic rate equation approaches - set different organic matter pools and breakdown processes - use standard inhibition or thermodynamic limits on primary oxidation - optionally use manganese, iron and iron sulphide reactions - simulate adsorbed metals and nutrients - simulate calcium, iron and manganese carbonates - connect the boundary to either another model, a programmed file or a fixed concentration Therefore the numerical model presented in this chapter has many optional features and alternative parameterisations for key processes, without mandating their inclusion in the calculations or enforcing a fixed model structure. To facilitate the coupling, the model is implemented with the “Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemical Models” (FABM), which is a new object-oriented model software framework by Bruggeman and Bolding (2014). Through the definition of a generic architecture for configuring and coupling both benthic and pelagic models, the FABM has been designed to couple a wide range of ecological and biogeochemical models from various developers with numerous different hydrodynamic models (Trolle et al. 2011). To date the FABM has been applied with the 1D lake hydrodynamic model GLM (Hipsey et al. 2014), and the unstructured mesh model TUFLOW-FV (Bruce et al. 2014). The sediment model CANDI-AED presented here is implemented within the AED model library within the FABM (Hipsey et al. 2013b), however, it is able to couple with one or more of the FABM model libraries (Figure 20.1). Through the model coupling approach it may be applied with any of the hydrodynamic models listed above, or alternatively, run in isolation. This document provides a complete scientific description of the model and describes attributes of the model associated with its practical implementation and operation. An application of the model framework is subsequently demonstrated. Figure 20.1: Schematic of the framework of aquatic biogeochemical models. The new diagenesis model code AED CANDI fits into the category of multilayer 1D diagenesis models, coupled to other biogeochemical and physical models (Trolle et al. 2011) 20.3 Model Description The heart of this model is the reaction, diffusion, advection model of Berner (1980), which was implemented as the Carbon and Nutrient Diagenesis model of Boudreau (1996) and developed into Approach 1 from Chapter 2. The basic structure of this model is an adaptation of the C.CANDI code (Luff et al. 2000), which added extensions related to the geochemical aspects. Further additions to the C.CANDI code have been made to: - the organic matter dynamics - the geochemical dynamics - extensions for nutrients and trace metals The chemical reactions included in this model, including new features added to the model, are expanded upon below and summarised in Figure 20.2. Figure 20.2: AED CANDI includes chemical processes of organic matter transformation and oxidation, and reduction/oxidation, crystallisation, adsorption and precipitation reactions of inorganic by-products. Most of the processes are triggered by the input of POM at the sediment-water interface. 20.3.1 Process Descriptions Primary Redox Reactions The key chemical process that causes ongoing change in the sediment is the breakdown of organic matter. The user can decide how complex or simple the organic matter breakdown pathway should be, with three options of varying complexity for parameterising the pathways included (Figure 5 - 3). The first option (OMModel = 1) is a common multi-G model in which the POM phases are decomposed straight to CO2 and other breakdown products. Here POM is a variable that is not precisely defined, and its components (such as C, N and P) must be determined in post-processing based on a user-defined fixed stoichiometry. The second option (OMModel = 2) is another 2G model with both particulate and dissolved organic matter (POM and DOM) phases included and parameterisation hydrolysis of POM to DOM, and then DOM to CO2 and other breakdown products. The POM and DOM phases consist of three variables each, which trace the reaction and transport of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus, thereby allowing for variable stoichiometry of organic matter to occur temporally and spatially. The third option (OMModel = 3) has many POM phases, which are all hydrolysed to DOM, which then undergoes fermentation and terminal metabolism, as using the mechanistic approach from Chapter 3. This allows the carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus to be calculated precisely before and after a model run, and allows the free energies of the reaction of each phase to be included. This third option is the most detailed and mechanistic, and allows for expansion of more detailed reaction mechanisms to be included.

The terminal redox reaction pathways are the six pathways that are available in most diagenesis models, and are driven by different organic matter pools, depending on the OMModel configuration chosen from the above options (Table 5 - 2). AED CANDI allows the use of Approach 1 or 2 organic matter oxidation rate equations, as examined in detail in Paraska et al (in prep). The rate equation for the oxidation of the oxidants with any of the pools above can include any of the terms in equation 5 - 12, where \\(R_{{Ox}_i}\\) is the reaction of an oxidant \\(i\\) (Arndt et al. 2013) (Table 5 - 3). The kinetic rate constant \\(k_{OM}\\) gives the maximum oxidation rate, which is different for each reactive type, but the same for each oxidation pathway. Alternatively, using OMModel 3, the kinetic rate constant is the rate of bacterial growth. The factor for terminal electron acceptor (TEA) limitation is FTEA (5 - 11), where options for Approach 1 or Approach 2 equations are available. The Monod constant for rate limitation at low oxidant concentration is \\(K_{TEA}\\) in Approach 1 and LTEA in Approach 2. Similarly, the inhibition term \\(F_{In}\\) (5 - 14) can be set to Approach 1 or 2 equations, or turned off entirely. The constant for inhibition until low oxidant concentrations is \\(K_{In}\\) for Approach 1 and \\(L_{IN}\\) for Approach 2. \\(F_{T}\\) is the thermodynamic factor, as described in chapter 3. The current version of the model includes FT only for OMModel 3, for terminal oxidation reactions and fermentation. \\(F_{OM}\\) is the organic matter concentration and may be a Monod function as in equation 5 - 8 (\\(K_{OM}\\) is a half saturation constant and the index \\(i\\) is the reactive phase). Using OMModels 1 and 2, \\(F_{OM}\\) is the concentration of the substrate, rather than a Monod function. The current version of the model has switches built in for both the temperature dependence factor, \\(F_{Tem}\\), where values of 1 or 2 turn them off and on. However, implementation and testing of the factors has not been carried out for this version of the model. The metabolism rate at \\(T_{0}\\) is \\(R_{0}\\), \\(ξ\\) is a scaling constant (see, for example, Eldridge and Morse 2008). Secondary Redox Reactions In the meta-analysis, we identified the many secondary redox reactions that have been included across the diversity of diagenesis model applications. In AED CANDI, they are all included as options, and may be turned on or off as desired (Table 5 - 4). Equilibrium Geochemistry The pH is calculated as the sum of all charged species, where any unbalanced positive charge indicates H+. The charge balance is at each time step is solved as a state variable, which is subject to advection, diffusion and bioturbation reactions. The precipitation of minerals is solved as an equilibrium reaction, dependent on the concentrations of the dissolved and solid substances, their \\(K_{sp}\\) and ion activity product (IAP). The equations are applied in a similar manner to those in Van Cappellen and Wang (1996) and numerous other studies, but with the exact forms of the equations based on those from Tufano et al. (2009) (Table 5 - 5). A positive rate indicates precipitation and a negative rate indicates dissolution. This model applies the function to all mineral simulated, including Fe(OH)3, FeS, FeS2, FeCO3, CaCO3 and MnCO3. This model has a process of mineral ageing, whereby iron and manganese oxides become crystalline and no longer react with organic matter, but can still undergo secondary redox reactions. Physical Transport The analysis from chapter 2 showed that advection and diffusion reactions (equations 5 - 102, 5 - 103) are fairly consistent in diagenesis models, and here we use the same methods (Table 5 - 8). Porosity (ϕ) is defined according to equation 5 - 104, which allows it to decrease with depth, and the solid fraction is defined from \\(\\phi_s=1-\\phi)\\). For bioturbation the model uses a diffusion coefficient that varies with depth (\\(D_{B(x)}\\)) as a two layer function or a Gaussian decrease (Boudreau 1996). For the porewater components, diffusion coefficients are used that are based on free-solution molecular diffusion constants corrected for sediment tortuosity, \\(θ\\), according to equation 5 - 105. 20.3.2 Variable Summary 20.3.3 Parameter Summary 20.3.4 Optional Module Links 20.3.5 Feedbacks to the Host Model 20.4 Setup &amp; Configuration The preceding details were an explanation of the scientific aspects of this diagenesis model, and next we turn to practical implementation. 20.4.1 Implementation withing the FABM Framework The sediment diagenesis model AED CANDI is one module of the AED library (Table 5 - 9, Hipsey et al. 2013b), which is composed of numerous model components. The FABM allows any combination of these modules, or any other model package, to be included in a model simulation and couples them to a physical model of the water column, which provides the spatial and temporal resolution, and calculates the transport processes (Figure 5 - 1). The AED library is just one set that could be used with the FABM framework, where others include the Fasham model template (based on Fasham et al. 1990) or the simple NPZD model of Burchard et al. (2005). A range of physical models and configurations is also available, depending on whether the focus is on the sediment alone, or the sediment as part of a larger environmental simulation (Figure 5 - 3). Refer here for further up to date information about the FABM and available model codes. Figure 20.4: Spatial resolution options available through FABM. a) Water column studies have traditionally assigned a flux to the sediment water interface without resolving the sediment chemical concentrations by depth, though they can be resolved laterally. b) The 0D water column is the method used in most sediment diagenesis studies, and use of multiple sediment zones is an option available within the FABM. 20.4.2 Program Structure The general structure of the program is shown in Figure 5 - 5. The program is firstly initialised, then loops through the kinetic and equilibrium reactions for each time step and writes the resulting concentrations and rates at each depth to an output file. The kinetic reactions are solved by the VODE program (Brown et al. 1989) and the equilibrium reactions by the Simplex program. Figure 20.5: The program is firstly initialised, then loops through the kinetic and equilibrium reactions for each time step and writes the resulting concentrations and rates at each depth to an output file. The kinetic reactions are solved by the VODE program (Brown et al. 1989) and the equilibrium reactions by the Simplex program. 20.4.3 Model Setup, Boundary Conditions &amp; Parameter Definition The model is set up via the name list text file fabm.nml using the model keyword “aed_seddiagenesis” with the model configured to select the “Dynamic” option. Once this is selected, the model will search for the “&amp;aed_sedcandi” parameter block within fabm.nml. Each active sediment model within the FABM model is discretised into a user definable number of depth layers (maxnpts) that start at a thickness of a few mm at the sediment-water interface and which increase exponentially down to a pre-defined sediment depth (xl). Users must define the sediment domain physical properties as summarised in Table 5 - 10, including configuration options related to bioturbation and irrigation. The biogeochemical configuration (Table 5 - 11), rate constants (see Table 5 - 12 and Table 5 - 13) must be set according to the sub-model options described above. The initial conditions for each variable are set as a list by the “initial_vals”, which sets a constant concentration with depth in units of μmol L-1. For organic matter initial concentrations only, there are three available options for the concentration with depth, set by “OMInitMethodL”. The sediment-water interface is the uppermost layer of the sediment, for which there are three configuration options set by the parameter ibc2. If the user specifies ibc2 = 2, the concentration is a constant value set by default_vals in the fabm.nml name list. For ibc2 = 1, the concentration is provided by a “link_variable”, which provides the concentration from another simulated water column FABM module. If the variable name in the link list is left blank (“ ”) then AED_CANDI will assume these variables are not linked to any water column variables and default to the “default_vals” values. If ibc2 = 10, the concentration is provided by a user-prescribed temporally variable value read from the file aed_sediment_swibc.dat. This option may desirable, for example, for simulating a seasonally or daily changing boundary condition. Regardless of the ibc2 surface boundary condition option, fluxes of dissolved species occur between the sediment and water column. They are calculated from the concentration gradient at the sediment-water interface according to Fick’s Law: \\[\\begin{equation} F = D_{0}\\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{D_{0}}{\\delta} (C_{bw} - C_{1}) \\tag{20.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(D_{0}\\) is the diffusivity as defined above, \\(\\delta\\) is the thickness of the diffusive boundary layer at the sediment water interface and defined as the length scale of the first sediment layer, \\(C_{bw}\\) is the bottom water concentration and \\(C_{1}\\) is the concentration in the top sediment layer. At the bottom of the domain (\\(x\\) = “xl”) the model can be specified to have a fixed-concentration (ibbc = 0) such that the concentration at \\(xl = C_{Bot}\\), or it can be specified to have a zero-derivative (ibbc = 1) defined as \\(\\frac{dC}{dx}=0\\) at \\(x = xl\\). 20.4.4 Model Output &amp; Post-processing The model output files are written for each variable as text files, giving time (in years) as the first column depth as the first row and concentrations in the other fields. These can be read in using a data processing program such as R, Matlab or Excel for analysis. Further, the model outputs the file rates.sed for each variable at every depth for the final time step. 20.5 Case Studies &amp; Examples 20.5.1 Case Study 20.5.2 Publications "],

The model is originally based on an application to Oneida Lake and Lake Erie for mussels. One to several size classes of mussels are simulated based on physiological parameters assembled by Schneider (1992) and modified by Bierman et al. (2005) to estimate effect of mussels on Saginaw Bay, Michigan, USA; a formulation also used by Gudimov et al. (2015) to estimate mussel effects in Lake Simcoe, Ontario, Canada. Additionally, some model structure was taken from the Spillman et al. (2008) model of Tapes clams in the Barbamarco Lagoon, Italy, as modified by Bocaniov et al. (2014) for mussels in Lake Erie. The physiology of mussels are set to be size dependent, and can vary between species (e.g., Zebra vs Quagga)(Hetherington, 2016). Three size classes of mussels can be incorporated in the model, roughly corresponding to age-0, age-1 and age&gt;1 mussels. Physiological parameters are calculated for the weight assigned to each age class, using equations in Table 4. Individual mussel mass is given in mmol C or in the case of calculations of N and P budgets, in mmol N and mmol P. The stoichiometric ratios (C:N:P) are fixed. Group mussel biomass is calculated at each time step by calculating ingestion and subtracting pseudofeces production, standard dynamic action, respiration, excretion, egestion and mortality (expressed in mmol C/mmol C/day, mmol N/mmol N/day; mmol P/mmol P/day). Several of these processes are also functions of temperature, algal+POC concentrations, salinity, suspended solids and mussel density. The effect of salinity, suspended solids and mussel density is incorporated as a multiplier of filtration rate with the multipliers having values between -0 – (no filtering) and 1 (no effect). Mussel nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations are fixed ratios of mussel carbon concentrations. Since the various input and output fluxes have variable C:N:P ratios, the excretion of nutrients is dynamically adjusted each time-step to maintain this ratio at each time step. Reproduction and larval dynamics are not simulated. There is no transfer of biomass between age groups. 23.3 Model Description 23.3.1 Process Descriptions Ingestion Ingestion is modelled as a function of filtration rate, food availability, pseudofeces production, density, suspended solids, and salinity (Equation 2) (Schneider 1992; Bierman et al. 2005; Spillman et al. 2008; Gudimov et al. 2015). Filtration rate is based on maximum ingestion, temperature, food availability, and pseudofeces production according to the following: \\[\\begin{equation} FR = \\frac{\\frac{I_{max}*f(T)_{I}}{K_{A}}}{PF_{min}} \\text{ for } [A] &lt; KA \\tag{23.1} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} FR = \\frac{\\frac{I_{max}*f(T)_{I}}{[A]}}{PF_{min}} \\text{ for } [A] &gt; KA \\tag{23.2} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(FR\\) is filtration rate (mmol/mmol/d), \\(Imax\\) is maximum ingestion rate (mmol/mmol/d), \\(f(T)_{I}\\) is filtration temperature function, \\(K_{A}\\) is optimum algal concentration (mmol/m3), \\([A]\\) is algal concentration + particulate organic carbon (POC) concentration (mmol/m3), and \\(PFmin\\) is minimum pseudofeces production (-). The maximum ingestion rate is based on weight from length according to the following: \\[\\begin{equation} I_{max} = (a_{I} * W^{bI}) \\tag{23.3} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} W = \\frac{0.071}{1000} * L^{2.8} \\tag{23.4} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(Imax\\) is maximum ingestion rate (mmol/mmol/d), \\(a_{I}\\) is maximum standard ingestion rate (mmol/mmol/d), \\(W\\) is weight (g), \\(bI\\) is exponent for weight effect on ingestion, \\(L\\) in length (mm) (Schneider 1992; Bierman et al. 2005). The temperature dependence function (Thornton and Lessem 1978) was fit to zebra and quagga mussel data (Hetherington et al. Submitted) with optimal ingestion from 17°C to 20°C according to the following: \\[\\begin{equation} f(T)_{I} = 1 \\text{ for } T_{min_{I}} &lt; T &lt; T_{max_{I}} \\tag{23.5} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} f(T)_{I} = (2*\\frac{Tmin_{TI}}{Tmin_{I}} - \\frac{(Tmin_{TI})^2}{(Tmin_{I})^2}) / (2*\\frac{Tmin_{I}-minT_{I}}{Tmin_{I}}-\\frac{(Tmin_{I}-minT_{I})^2}{(Tmin_{I})^2}) \\text{ for } minT_{I} &lt; T &lt; Tmin_{I} \\tag{23.6} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} f(T)_{I} = -\\frac{(T^{2} + 2*Tmax_{I}*T–2*Tmax_{I}*maxT_{I} + maxT_{I}^{2})}{(Tmax_{I}-maxT_{I})^{2}} \\text{ for } Tmax_{I}&lt;T&lt;maxT_{I} \\tag{23.7} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} f(T)_{I} = 0 \\text{ for } T &gt; maxT_{I} \\text{ or } T &lt; minT_{I} \\tag{23.8} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(T\\) is temperature (°C), \\(minT_{I}\\) is lower temperature for no ingestion (°C), \\(Tmin_{I}\\) is lower temperature for optimum ingestion (°C), \\(Tmax_{I}\\) is upper temperature for optimum ingestion, \\(maxT_{I}\\) is upper temperature for no ingestion (°C). Filtration rate is related to food concentration [Walz (1978); Sprung and Rose (1988); Schneider (1992); Bierman et al. (2005)). The filtration rate is maintained at a maximum value for all food values less than saturation food concentration. The filtration rate decreases as food concentrations increase above this value. Pseudofeces production is implicit as the difference between the mass filtered and consumed. According to Walz (1978), pseudofeces production (66%) was approximately double the ingestion rate (34%) at high food concentrations Bierman et al. (2005). Mussel density limits ingestion above some maximum density according to the following: \\[\\begin{equation} $f(D) = 1$ for $D&lt;Dmax$ \\tag{23.9} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} f(D) = \\frac{-(D^{2} + 2*Dmax*D – 2*Dmax*maxD + maxD^{2})}{(Dmax – maxD)^{2}} \\text{ for } D&gt;Dmax \\tag{23.10} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} f(D) = 0 \\text{ for } D&gt;maxD \\tag{23.11} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(D\\) is density (mmol/m2), \\(Dmax\\) is upper density for optimum ingestion (mmol/m2), and \\(maxD\\) is upper density for no ingestion (mmol/m2). An additional function to reduce ingestion is the suspended solids function which decreases ingestion with high inorganic loads according to the following: \\[\\begin{equation} f(SS) = 1 \\text{ for } SS&lt;SSmax \\tag{23.12} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} f(SS) = \\frac{-(SS^{2} + 2*SSmax*SS – 2*SSmax*maxSS + maxSS^{2})}{(SSmax – maxSS)^{2}} \\text{ for } SS&gt;SSmax \\tag{23.13} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} f(SS) = 0 \\text{ for } SS&gt;maxSS \\tag{23.14} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(SS\\) is suspended solids (mg/L), \\(SSmax\\) is upper suspended solids for optimum ingestion (mg/L), and \\(maxSS\\) is upper suspended solids for no ingestion (mg/L) (Spillman et al. 2008). Along with suspended solids, salinity limits ingestion according to the following: \\[\\begin{equation} f(S) = 1 \\text{ for } Smin &lt; S &lt; Smax \\tag{23.15} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} f(S) = \\frac{(2*(S-minS)/Smin)–(S-minS)^{2}/Smin^{2})}{(2*(Smin-minS)/Smin)–(Smin-minS)^{2}/Smin^{2})} \\text{ for } minS&lt; S &lt; Smin \\tag{23.16} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} f(S) = \\frac{-(S^{2} + 2*Smax*S – 2*Smax*maxS + maxS^{2})}{(Smax-maxS)^{2}} \\text{ for } Smax&lt;S&lt;maxS \\tag{23.17} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} f(S) = 0 \\text{ for } S &gt; maxS \\text{ or } S &lt; minS \\tag{23.18} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(S\\) is salinity (psu), \\(minS\\) is lower salinity for no ingestion (psu), \\(Smin\\) is lower salinity for optimum ingestion (psu), \\(Smax\\) is upper salinity for optimum ingestion (psu), \\(maxS\\) is upper salinity for no ingestion (psu) (Spillman et al. 2008). Respiration Respiration is modelled as a base or standard respiration rate based on weight and temperature (Spillman et al. 2008). Respiration rate coefficient at 20°C is based on weight from length according to the following: \\[\\begin{equation} R_{20} = (a_{R} * W^{b}_{R}) \\tag{23.19} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} W = \\frac{0.071}{1000} * L^{2.8} \\tag{23.20} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(R_{20}\\) is respiration rate coefficient at 20°C (mmol/mmol/d), \\(a_{R}\\) is standard respiration rate (mmol/mmol/d), \\(W\\) is weight (g), \\(b_{R}\\) is exponent for weight effect of respiration, and \\(L\\) is length (mm) (Schneider 1992). The respiration rate coefficient is adjusted for temperature according to the following: \\[\\begin{equation} f(T)_{RSpillman} = \\Theta_{RSpillman}^{T-20} \\tag{23.21} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(f(T)_{RSpillman}\\) is respiration temperature function, \\(\\Theta_{RSpillman}\\) is temperature multiplier for bivalve respiration (-), and \\(T\\) is temperature (°C) (Spillman et al. 2008). Alternatively, respiration is modelled as a base or standard respiration rate based on weight and temperature in addition to the energetic cost of feeding. Respiration rate coefficient at 30°C is based on weight from length according to the following: \\[\\begin{equation} R_{30} = (a^{R} * W^{b}_{R}) \\tag{23.22} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} W = \\frac{0.071}{1000} * L^{2.8} \\tag{23.23} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(R_{30}\\) is respiration rate coefficient at 30°C (mmol/mmol/d), \\(a^{R}\\) is standard respiration rate (mmol/mmol/d), \\(W\\) is weight (g), \\(b_{R}\\) is exponent for weight effect of respiration, and \\(L\\) is length (mm) (Schneider 1992). The temperature function follows Schneider (1992) application of the model of Kitchell, Stewart, and Weininger (1977) to the data of Jr and McMahon (2004) according to the following: \\[\\begin{equation} f(T)_{RSchneider} = V^{X} * e^{X * (1-V)} \\tag{23.24} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} V = \\frac{Tmax_{R} – T}{Tmax_{R} – maxT_{R}} \\tag{23.25} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} X = (\\frac{W*(1+\\sqrt{1 + (\\frac{40}{Y})})}{20})^2 \\tag{23.26} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} W = lnQ_{R}*(Tmax_{R} – maxT_{R}) \\tag{23.27} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} Y = lnQ_{R}*(Tmax_{R} – maxT_{R} + 2) \\tag{23.28} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(T\\) is temperature (°C), \\(Tmax_{R}\\) is upper temperature for optimum respiration (°C), \\(maxT_{R}\\) is upper temperature for no respiration (°C), and \\(Q_{R}\\) is respiration curve slope estimate (-). The maximum respiration occurs at 30°C with 43°C as the upper lethal temperature. The energetic cost of feeding or specific dynamic action is applied only to the portion of ingestion that is not egested (Schneider 1992; Bierman et al. 2005; Gudimov et al. 2015). Excretion Excretion is modelled as a constant fraction of assimilated food (Schneider 1992; Bierman et al. 2005; Gudimov et al. 2015). Excretion data for zebra and quagga mussels are limited; therefore, the excretion formulation for Mytilus edulis derived by Bayne and Newell (1983) was used (Schneider 1992; Bierman et al. 2005; Gudimov et al. 2015). Egestion Egestion is modeled as a function of ingestion (Schneider 1992; Bierman et al. 2005; Gudimov et al. 2015). The model follows the assumption that ingestion is directly proportional to the food content of the water for all food concentrations less than the maximum which can be ingested. For all food concentrations above this saturation value, ingestion remains constant at a maximum value (\\(I_{max}\\)) (Walz 1978). Mortality Mortality is a function of dissolved oxygen and predation (Equation 7). Mortality increases with low dissolved oxygen concentrations according to the following: \\[\\begin{equation} f(DO) = 1 + K_{BDO} * \\frac{K_{DO}}{K_{DO} + DO} \\tag{23.29} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(DO\\) is dissolved oxygen (mmol/m3), \\(K_{BDO}\\) is basal respiration rate (mmol/m3), and \\(K_{DO}\\) is half saturation constant for metabolic response to dissolved oxygen (mmol/m3) (Spillman et al. 2008). A mortality rate coefficient (\\(K_{MORT}\\)) further influences the dissolved oxygen function. Additionally, mortality from predation is a constant rate added to the effect from dissolved oxygen. 23.3.2 Variable Summary State Variables Table 23.1: State variables Variable Name Description Units Variable Type Core/Optional BIV_{group} Bivalve group \\(mmol C\\,m^{-2}\\,day^{-1}\\) Benthic Core BIV_filtfrac Filtered fraction of water % Pelagic Optional : biv_tracer = .true.
