## We invite you to contribute to these chapters! {-}

**bookdown** makes editing a book as easy as editing a wiki, provided you have a GitHub account ([sign-up at github.com](https://github.com/)).
Once logged-in to GitHub, click on the 'edit me' icon highlighted with a red ellipse in the image below.

This will take you to an editable version of the the source [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) file that generated the page you're on:

To raise an issue about the book's content (e.g. code not running) or make a feature request, check-out the [issue tracker]https://github.com/AquaticEcoDynamics/aed-science/issues).

Readers may also use the hypothes.is utility on the right margin of the book to add personal annotations and public comments on the book content.

Maintainers and contributors must follow this repositoryâ€™s [CODE OF CONDUCT](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Editing the book{-}

To build the book locally, clone or download the aed-science repo, load R in root directory (e.g. by opening aed-sceince.Rproj in RStudio) and run the following lines:

```{r eval=FALSE}

bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd") # to build the book
browseURL("_book/index.html") # to view it
