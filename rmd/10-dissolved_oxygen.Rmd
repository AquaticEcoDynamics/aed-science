## Overview

Dissolved Oxygen ($DO$ or $O_2$) is considered to be one of the most important indicators of aquatic ecosystem conditions and is commonly used in models of water quality. Eutrophication and climate change pressures are exacerbating issues of hypoxia and anoxia in waters, ranging from small wetlands, lakes, and the coastal ocean.

$O_2$ dynamics respond to processes of atmospheric exchange, sediment oxygen demand, microbial respiration during organic matter mineralisation and nitrification, photosynthetic oxygen production and respiratory oxygen consumption, chemical oxygen demand, and respiration by other biotic components such as seagrass and bivalves.

The $\mathrm{AED}$ oxygen module is suitable for a wide range of waterbody types, from ponds and wetlands, to lakes estuaries and the coastal ocean.

## Model Description

This module supports one state variable to capture the oxygen concentration, $O_2$. The module is a low-level module that supports the two core processes of air-water exchange, $\check{f}_{atm}^{O_2}$, and sediment-water exchange, $\hat{f}_{sed}^{O_2}$, and is designed to be linked to by other modules that interact with oxygen. The dynamics of $O_2$ can therefore be summarised as:

\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{D}{Dt}O_2 =  \color{darkgray}{ \mathbb{M} + \mathcal{S} } \quad
&+&   \overbrace{\check{f}_{atm}^{O_2}+\hat{f}_{sed}^{O_2}}^\text{aed_oxygen} \\ (\#eq:oxy1)
&-& \color{brown}{ f_{min}^{DOC} - f_{nitrf}^{NH_4} - f_{ch4ox}^{CH_4} - f_{h2sox}^{H_2S} - f_{feox}^{H_2S} } \\ \nonumber
&+& \color{brown}{ f_{gpp}^{PHY}	- f_{rsp}^{PHY} - f_{rsp}^{ZOO} + \hat{f}_{gpp}^{MAC} - \hat{f}_{rsp}^{MAC} + f_{gpp}^{MAG} - f_{rsp}^{MAG} - \hat{f}_{rsp}^{BIV} } \\ \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

where $\mathbb{M}$ and $\mathcal{S}$ refer to water mixing and boundary source terms, respectively, and the coloured $\color{brown}{f}$ terms reflect the optionally configurable contributions from other modules; these include the breakdown of $DOC$ by aerobic heterotrophic bacteria to $CO_2$, whereby a stoichiometrically equivalent amount of oxygen is removed, chemical oxidation reactions, such as nitrification or sulfide oxidation, photosynthetic oxygen production and respiratory consumption by phytoplankton, and also oxygen consumed and produced by any benthic biological groups.

### Process Descriptions

<!-- previously from 'aed2_oxygen : oxygen solubility & atmospheric exchange' on website version-->
#### Oxygen solubility & atmospheric exchange {-}
Atmospheric exchange is typically modelled based on Wanninkhof (1992) and the flux equation of Riley and Skirrow (1974) for the open water, and on Ho et al. (2011) for estuarine environments.
\begin{equation}
								F_{atm}^{O_2} = k_{O_2} \left({O_2}_{air} - {O_2}_{s}\right) (\#eq:oxy2)
\end{equation}
where $k_{O_2}$ is the oxygen gas transfer velocity $(m/s)$, ${O_2}_{s} (gm^{-3})$ is the oxygen concentration in the surface waters near the air-water interface and $C_{air} (gm^{-3})$ is the concentration of oxygen in the air phase near the interface. A positive flux represents input of oxygen from the atmosphere to the water. $C_{air}$ is dependent on temperature, $T$, salinity, $S$ and atmospheric pressure, $p$, as given by:
\begin{eqnarray}
							C_{air}\left(T,S,p \right) &=& 1.42763\: f\left(p\right) \exp \left\{ -173.4292+249.6339 \left[\frac{100}{\theta_k}\right] + 143.3483 \ln \left[ \frac{\theta_k}{100}\right] \right. \nonumber \\ &-& \left. 21.8492 \left[\frac{\theta_k}{100}\right] + S\left(-0.033096 +0.014259 \left[\frac{\theta_k}{100}\right] -0.0017 \left[\frac{\theta_k}{100}\right]^2 \right) \right\}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\theta_k$ is temperature in degrees Kelvin, salinity is expressed as parts per thousand and atmospheric pressure is in kPa. The pressure correction function, $f(p)$ varies between one and zero for the surface and high altitudes respectively:
\begin{equation}
							f\left(p\right)=\frac{p_H}{p_{SL}}\left[1-\frac{p_{vap}}{p_H}\right]/\left[1-\frac{p_{vap}}{p_{SL}}\right].
\end{equation}


#### Sediment oxygen demand {-}
Modelling sediment oxygen demand can take a variety of forms. The simplest form in AED2 is the $SOD$ varies as a function of the overlying water temperature and dissolved oxygen levels.
\begin{equation}
							f_{O_2}^{DSF}(T,DO)= S_{SOD}\:f_{SED}^{T2}(T)\:f_{SOD}^{DO1}(DO)
\end{equation}

Where $S_{SOD}$ is a fixed oxygen flux across the sediment-water interface and $K_{DO_{SOD}}$ is a half-saturation constant for the sediment oxygen demand.

#### Other oxygen sources/sinks (optional) {-}
- Oxygen consumption during baterial mineralisation of DOC is done in the bacteria module - aed2_bacteria;
- Oxygen consumption during nitrification is done in the nitrogen module - [aed2_nitrogen][Inorganic Nutrients: C/N/P/Si];
- Oxygen production/consumption by phytoplankton phtosynthesis/respiration is done in the phytoplankton module - [aed2_phytoplankton][Phytoplankton];
- Oxygen consumption due to zooplankton respiration is done in the zooplankton module - [aed2_zooplankton][Zooplankton];
- Oxygen production/consumption by seagrass phtosynthesis/respiration is done in the bateria module - aed2_seagrass;
- Oxygen consumption due to bivalve respiration is done in the benthic module - [aed2_benthic][Benthic Vegetation];
