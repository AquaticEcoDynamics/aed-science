# Modelling Aquatic Eco-Dynamics: Overview of the AED modular simulation platform {-}

## Welcome! {-}

This is the online home of *Modelling Aquatic Eco-Dynamics*, a book on describing the AED (previously released as AED2) modelling platform for the simulation of aquatic ecosystem dynamics.

Inspired by [**bookdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) and the Open Data movement in ecology and the environmental sciences, this book is open source. This encourages a collaborative approach to model development and discussion and ensures the approaches adopted by the user community are reproducible and publicly accessible for people worldwide.

The model platform has been applied to many diverse sites across the globe (Figure \@ref(fig:aed-sites)) and we hope it can be useful to help with your application!

```{r aed-sites, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Locations", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
library(dplyr)
library(htmlwidgets)
library(htmltools)
aed_icon  <- makeIcon(
  iconUrl = "maps/marker.png",
  iconWidth = 23, iconHeight = 23)

aed_sites <- read.csv("maps/aed-sites.csv")
leaflet(height=400, width="auto") %>% addProviderTiles(providers$Esri.WorldGrayCanvas) %>%
  setView(lng = 0, lat = 0, zoom = 1) %>%
  addMarkers(data = aed_sites, ~Lon, ~Lat, popup = ~Model, icon = aed_icon)

```

## How to contribute?{-}

You may be a new user seeking to understand how to get started, or you may be interested in tailoring a module to your research or management application. As modules evolve, through incremental improvements or wholesale changes, the experts working on these changes can ensure the latest information is available to the community by continuously updating and improving this book.

**bookdown** makes editing a book as easy as editing a wiki, provided you have a GitHub account ([sign-up at github.com](https://github.com/)).
Once logged-in to GitHub, click on the 'edit me' icon highlighted with a red ellipse in the image below.

This will take you to an editable version of the the source [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) file that generated the page you're on:

<center>
```{r editting, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/index/edit.png")
```
</center>

To raise an issue about the book's content (e.g. code not running) or make a feature request, check-out the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/issues).

Readers may also use the hypothes.is utility on the right margin of the book to add personal annotations and public comments on the book content.

Maintainers and contributors must follow this repositoryâ€™s [CODE OF CONDUCT](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Editing the book{-}

To build the book locally, clone or download the aed-science repo, load R in root directory (e.g. by opening aed-sceince.Rproj in RStudio) and run the following lines:

```{r eval=FALSE}

bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd") # to build the book
browseURL("_book/index.html") # to view it

```
## How to cite this book{-}
