  abstract = {{Knowledge of air-water gas transfer velocities and water residence times is necessary to study the fate of mangrove derived carbon exported into surrounding estuaries and ultimately to determine carbon balances in mangrove ecosystems. For the first time, the 3He/SF6 dual tracer technique, which has been proven to be a powerful tool to determine gas transfer velocities in the ocean, is applied to Shark River, an estuary situated in the largest contiguous mangrove forest in North America. The mean gas transfer velocity was 3.3 ± 0.2 cm h−1 during the experiment, with a water residence time of 16.5 ± 2.0 days. We propose a gas exchange parameterization that takes into account the major sources of turbulence in the estuary (i.e., bottom generated shear and wind stress).}},

Oxygen concentrations were found to vary around an average value of 0.8 mlSTP (standard temperature and pressure) per kg. Dissolved oxygen variations were found to reflect both physical processes (a deepening of the epilimnion, a turnover etc.) and chemical processes (oxidation reduction). Transport coefficients for the oxygen exchange across the air/sea interface were found to be generally low compared to expected values based on laboratory experiments; the presence of surface films which inhibit the gas exchange rates under calm weather conditions is suspected. During stormy weather, the exchange rates were considerably higher, suggesting that the entrainment of bubbles was involved in the gas exchange process.}},

  abstract = {{The relationship between gas exchange and wind speed is used extensively for estimating bulk fluxes of atmospheric gases across the air-sea interface. Here, I provide an update on the frequently used method of Wanninkhof (1992). The update of the methodology reflects advances that have occurred over the past two decades in quantifying the input parameters. The general principle of obtaining a relationship constrained by the globally integrated bomb-14CO2 flux into the ocean remains unchanged. The improved relationship is created using revised global ocean 14C inventories and improved wind speed products. Empirical relationships of the Schmidt number, which are necessary to determine the fluxes, are extended to 40°C to facilitate their use in the models. The focus is on the gas exchange of carbon dioxide, but the suggested functionality can be extended to other gases at intermediate winds (≈4−15 m s−1). The updated relationship, expressed as k = 0.251 <U2> (Sc/660)−0.5 where k is the gas transfer velocity, <U2> is the average squared wind speed, and Sc is the Schmidt number, has a 20\% uncertainty. The relationship is in close agreement with recent parameterizations based on results from gas exchange process studies over the ocean.}},

  abstract = {{Relationships between wind speed and gas transfer, combined with knowledge of the partial pressure difference of CO2 across the air‐sea interface are frequently used to determine the CO2 flux between the ocean and the atmosphere. Little attention has been paid to the influence of variability in wind speed on the calculated gas transfer velocities and the possibility of chemical enhancement of CO2 exchange at low wind speeds over the ocean. The effect of these parameters is illustrated using a quadratic dependence of gas exchange on wind speed which is fit through gas transfer velocities over the ocean determined by the natural‐14C disequilibrium and the bomb‐14C inventory methods. Some of the variability between different data sets can be accounted for by the suggested mechanisms, but much of the variation appears due to other causes. Possible causes for the large difference between two frequently used relationships between gas transfer and wind speed are discussed. To determine fluxes of gases other than CO2 across the air‐water interface, the relevant expressions for gas transfer, and the temperature and salinity dependence of the Schmidt number and solubility of several gases of environmental interest are included in an appendix.}},

  doi = {10.1002/lno.10444}, 
  abstract = {{Gas transfer velocities (k) of CO2 and CH4 were determined from 209 deployments of a newly designed floating chamber in six mangrove dominated estuaries in Australia and the United States to estimate mangrove system specific k. k600-CO2 and k600-CH4 (k normalized to the Schmidt number of 600) varied greatly within and between mangrove creeks, ranging from 0.9 cm h−1 to 28.3 cm h−1. The gas transfer velocity correlated well with current velocity at all study sites suggesting current generated turbulence was the main driver controlling k. An empirical relationship that accounts for current velocity and a linearly additive contribution of wind speed and water depth was a good predictor of k600-CO2 (R2 = 0.67) and k600-CH4 (R2 = 0.57) in the mangrove creeks in Australia. In a side-by-side study, good agreement was found between k determined from this new floating chamber and a 3He/SF6 dual tracer release experiment (∼5\% discrepancy). k600-CH4 correlated well with k600-CO2 (R2 = 0.81), however, k600-CH4 was on average 1.2 times higher than k600-CO2, most likely reflecting a microbubble flux contribution. The microbubble flux contributed up to 73\% of the total CH4 flux and was best predicted by a model that included CH4 supersaturation, temperature, and current velocity. A large overestimation was found for both CO2 and CH4 fluxes when calculated using empirically derived k models from previous studies in estuaries. The high temporal and spatial variabilities of kCO2 and kCH4 highlights the importance of site specific transfer velocity measurements in dynamic ecosystems such as mangrove estuaries.}},

  issn = {0148-0227}, 
  doi = {10.1029/2010jc006854}, 
  abstract = {{Two 3He/SF6 dual-gas tracer injections were conducted during the Southern Ocean Gas Exchange Experiment (SO GasEx) to determine gas transfer velocities. During the experiment, wind speeds of up to 16.4 m s−1 were encountered. A total of 360 3He and 598 SF6 samples were collected at 40 conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) rosette casts and two pumped stations. The gas transfer velocity k was calculated from the decrease in the observed 3He/SF6 ratio using three different approaches. Discrete points of wind speed and corresponding k were obtained from the change in 3He/SF6 ratio over three time intervals. The results were also evaluated using an analytical model and a 1-D numerical model. The results from the three approaches agreed within the error of the estimates of about ±13\%–15\% for Patch 1 and ±4\% for Patch 2. Moreover, 3He/SF6 dual-tracer results from SO GasEx are similar to those from other areas in both the coastal and open ocean and are in agreement with existing parameterizations between wind speed and gas exchange. This suggests that wind forcing is the major driver of gas exchange for slightly soluble gases in the ocean and that other known impacts are either intrinsically related to wind or have a small effect (<20\% on average) on time scales of the order of days to weeks. The functionality of the wind speed dependence (quadratic or cubic) cannot be unequivocally determined from SO GasEx results.}},

From concomitant measurements of the air-water CO2 gradient, we computed the gas transfer velocity of CO2. The gas transfer velocity is well correlated to wind speed and a simple linear regression function gives the most consistent fit to the data. Based on water current measurements, we estimated the contribution of water current induced turbulence to the gas transfer velocity, using the conceptual relationship of O'Connor and Dobbins (1958). This allowed us to construct an empirical relationship to compute the gas transfer velocity of CO2 that accounts for the contribution of wind and water current. Based on this relationship, the spatial and temporal variability of the gas transfer velocity in the Scheldt estuary was investigated. Water currents contribute significantly to the gas transfer velocity, but the spatial and temporal variability (from daily to seasonal scales) is mainly related to wind speed variability.}},
