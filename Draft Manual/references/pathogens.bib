  abstract = {{Rotaviruses are double-stranded RNA viruses which are among the most resistant waterborne enteric viruses to UV disinfection. An integrated cell culture and real-time RT-PCR (ICC real-time RT-PCR) assay was developed to detect the infectivity of rotaviruses in water, which uses real-time RT-PCR to detect RNA produced by infectious rotaviruses during replication in host cells. Detection of rotaviral RNA in host cells provides direct evidence of the presence of infectious rotavirus rather than just the presence of rotavirus RNA. Using this newly developed method, the inactivation and resistance of rotavirus to UV treatments at various doses was evaluated. With an initial concentration of 2×104PFU/ml simian rotavirus (SA11), a first-order linear relationship was obtained at UV dose range of 0–120mJcm−2, and the inactivation rate constant was estimated to be 0.0343cm2mJ−1 (R2=0.966). The dose-inactivation curve tailed off and reached plateau as the UV dose increased from 120 to 360mJcm−2, indicating resistance phenomena of sub-populations of SA11 at very high UV doses. A maximal reduction of 4.8log10 was observed. Through parallel comparison with traditional culture assay, the ICC real-time RT-PCR method demonstrated more effective, sensitive and faster infectivity detection of rotavirus and, the results reveal that rotaviruses are more resistant to UV irradiation than previously reported with traditional cell culture assays.}},

  abstract = {{Based on a comprehensive synthesis of data available within the literature, a new process-based model of microbial pollution is presented, which is applicable for surface and coastal waters. The model is based on a generic set of parameterisations that describe the dynamics of most protozoan, bacterial and viral organisms of interest, including pathogens and microbial indicator organisms. The parameterisations dynamically account for the effects of temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen, sunlight, nutrients and turbidity on the growth and mortality of enteric organisms. Parameters for a range of organisms are also presented which are based on collation of literature data. The model has been implemented within an aquatic ecology model, Computational Aquatic Ecosystem Dynamics Model (CAEDYM), which can couple to multidimensional hydrodynamic models. Without adjustment of the literature derived parameter values, a 3-D implementation is validated against observed data from three freshwater systems that differ in their climatic zone, trophic status and operation. The simulations highlight the spatial and temporal variability that may be encountered by operators. Additionally, large differences in the fate and distribution of different species originate from variable rates of growth, mortality and sedimentation and it is emphasized that the use of surrogates for quantifying risk is problematic. The model can be used to help design targeted monitoring programs, explore differences between species, and to support real-time decision-making. Areas where insufficient understanding and data exist are discussed.}},

The model consists of a module that simulates oocyst inactivation, resuspension, settling and aggregation onto particles. This module was coupled to the three‐dimensional Estuary Lake and Coastal Ocean Model (ELCOM), which was used to simulate lake hydrodynamics in addition to oocyst advection and turbulent diffusion. A field experiment that tracked the passage of a flood inflow throughout Myponga Reservoir, South Australia, was used to validate the coupled model. The model accurately captured the thermal dynamics, and the spatial and temporal distribution of different inorganic particle size classes and oocysts. The model and data indicate that oocysts do not readily attach to inorganic particles as other researchers have suggested but settle as free‐floating oocysts according to Stoke's sedimentation dynamics. The reduction in oocysts between the inflow and the offtake due to settling is therefore not as significant as previously thought. The potential for inactivation was also found to be small relative to the timescales for transport. The model is a useful tool to examine oocyst dynamics in lakes and reservoirs, to consider risk management assessments of different scenarios, and to assess the effectiveness of different sampling strategies.}},

The experimental program measured TC and EC at various locations and at multiple depths in a medium sized Australian reservoir subject to continuous inflow forcing. Particle concentrations and size distributions were measured using a LISST (Laser In Situ Scattering Transmissometer) profiler. Correlations between the particle measurements and the bacteria were calculated to provide in situ evidence for the association of TC and EC with suspended inorganic particles. Both TC and EC correlated most strongly with fine particles between 3.2 and 4.5 μm. Development of a simple Lagrangian model of the inflow for particles and microbes additionally provided insight into the relative roles of dilution, sedimentation, and inactivation for the bacteria. The model results and the correlations support the theory that high association with the small particles was due to their high number concentration and the effective surface area available for attachment. It was also evident that the majority of bacteria (> 80\%) were physically associated with the suspended particles and allowed a quantitative estimate of the net sedimentation rate. Bacterial attachment and the concomitant increase in settling should be considered when modeling bacterial dynamics, during design of monitoring programs and when implementing pathogen risk management strategies.}},

All sunlight inactivation (kS) rates, as a function of cumulative global solar radiation (insolation), were far higher than the corresponding dark (kD) rates, with a ranking (and average kS rates for seawater and river water, respectively) of: C. jejuni (3.23; 2.34)>S. enterica (0.51; 0.37)>E. coli (0.34; 0.26). All the T90 (time to 90\% inactivation) values were higher in winter than in summer, but there was far greater similarity between the summer and winter S90 (insolation needed for 90\% inactivation) values. The rapid inactivation of C. jejuni was attributed to a high susceptibility to photooxidative damage. The results suggest that, in sunlight-exposed waters, E. coli will be a more conservative indicator for C. jejuni than for S. enterica, and C. jejuni transmission as a pathogenic agent is less likely than for S. enterica.}},

  abstract = {{ Erosion and deposition of bottom sediments reflect a continual, dynamic adjustment between the fluid forces applied to a sediment bed and the condition of the bed itself. Erosion of fine and mixed sediment beds depends on their composition, their vertical structure, their disturbance/recovery history, and the biota that inhabit them. This paper presents a new one-dimensional (1D), multi-layer sediment bed model for simulating erosion and deposition of fine and mixed sediments subject to consolidation, armoring, and bioturbation. The distinguishing characteristics of this model are a greatly simplified first-order relaxation treatment for consolidation, a mud erosion formulation that adapts to both Type I and II erosion behavior and is based directly on observations, a continuous deposition formulation for mud that can mimic exclusive erosion and deposition behavior, and straightforward inclusion of bioturbation effects. Very good agreement with two laboratory data sets on consolidation effects is achieved by adjusting only the first-order consolidation rate rc . Full model simulations of three idealized cases based on upper Chesapeake Bay, USA observations are presented. In the mud only case, fluid stresses match mud critical stresses at maximum erosion. A consolidation lag results in higher suspended sediment concentrations after erosional events. Erosion occurs only during accelerating currents and deposition does not occur until just before slack water. In the mixed mud and sand case without bioturbation, distinct layers of high and low sand content form and mud suspension is strongly limited by sand armoring. In the mixed mud and sand case with bioturbation, suspended mud concentrations are greater than or equal to either of the other cases. Low surface critical stresses are mixed down into the bed, constrained by the tendency to return towards equilibrium. Sand layers and the potential for armoring of the bed develop briefly, but mix rapidly. This model offers a relatively simple and robust tool for simulating the complex interactions that can affect muddy and mixed sediment bed erodibility.}},

Quantitative viral risk assessment requires information concerning the ability of viruses detected in drinking water to infect their host. To obtain insight into the infectivity of viruses in relation to the presence of virus genomes, inactivation of three different enteroviruses in artificial ground and surface waters under different controlled pH, temperature, and salt conditions was studied by using both PCR and cell culture over time. In salt-peptone medium, the estimated ratio of RNA genomes to infectious poliovirus 1 in freshly prepared suspensions was about 100. At 4°C this ratio was 103 after 600 days, and at 22°C it was 104 after 200 days. For poliovirus 1 and 2 the RNA/infectious virus ratio was higher in artificial groundwater than in artificial surface water, but this was not the case for coxsackievirus B4. When molecular detection is used for virus enumeration, it is important that the fraction of infectious virus (based on all virus genomes detected) decays with time, especially at temperatures near 22°C.}},

The absence of a cell culture infectivity model for NoV necessitates the use of molecular methods and/or viral surrogate models amenable to cell culture to predict NoV inactivation. The NoV surrogates murine NoV (MNV), feline calicivirus (FCV), poliovirus (PV), and male-specific coliphage MS2, in conjunction with Norwalk virus (NV), were spiked into surface water samples (n = 9) and groundwater samples (n = 6). Viral persistence was monitored at 25°C and 4°C by periodically analyzing virus infectivity (for all surrogate viruses) and nucleic acid (NA) for all tested viruses. FCV infectivity reduction rates were significantly higher than those of the other surrogate viruses. Infectivity reduction rates were significantly higher than NA reduction rates at 25°C (0.18 and 0.09 log10/day for FCV, 0.13 and 0.10 log10/day for PV, 0.12 and 0.06 log10/day for MS2, and 0.09 and 0.05 log10/day for MNV) but not significant at 4°C. According to a multiple linear regression model, the NV NA reduction rates (0.04 ± 0.01 log10/day) were not significantly different from the NA reduction rates of MS2 (0.05 ± 0.03 log10/day) and MNV (0.04 ± 0.03 log10/day) and were significantly different from those of FCV (0.08 ± 0.03 log10/day) and PV (0.09 ± 0.03 log10/day) at 25°C. In conclusion, MNV shows great promise as a human NoV surrogate due to its genetic similarity and environmental stability. FCV was much less stable and thus questionable as an adequate surrogate for human NoVs in surface water and groundwater.}},

Heterotrophic plate count (HPC), total bacteria count (TBC), and total coliform (TC) were selected to evaluate the efficiency of different disinfection processes. UV inactivation of the three bacteria followed first-order kinetics in W1 wastewater, but in W2 wastewater, the UV dose–response curve trailed beyond approximately 10 mJ/cm2 UV. The higher number of particles in the W2 might have protected the bacteria against UV damage, as UV light alone was not effective in killing HPC in W2 wastewater with higher turbidity. However, chlorine was more effective in W2 than in W1 for the three bacteria inactivation owing to the greater formation of inorganic and organic chloramines in W1 wastewater. Complete inactivation of HPC in W1 wastewater required a chlorine dose higher than 5.5 mg/L, whereas 4.5 mg/L chlorine gave the equivalent result in W2 wastewater. In contrast, sequential UV and chlorine treatment produced a synergistic effect in both wastewater systems and was the most effective option for complete removal of all three bacteria. UV disinfection lowered the required chlorine dose in W1, but not in W2, because of the higher chlorine consumption in W2 wastewater. However, UV irradiation decreased total trihalomethane formation during chlorination in both wastewaters.}},

Viral stability was periodically assessed by both infectivity and real-time PCR methods.

No adenoviral genome degradation was observed at 4°C, and the reduction was estimated at 0.0036 log10/day at 20°C. Occurrence study showed that DNA of human adenoviruses could be observed in groundwater from a confined aquifer (7 of the 60 samples were positive by real-time PCR), while no fecal indicators were detected.

Applications of the model illustrate the importance of the sediment and identify parameters that require further study. The model predicts the field measurements of Jamieson et al.

First, the pathogen (norovirus, Cryptosporidium, Escherichia coli O157/H7) concentrations in faecal contamination sources around the drinking water source Lake Rådasjön in Sweden were estimated for endemic and epidemic conditions using measured concentrations of faecal indicators (E. coli and Bacteroidales genetic markers). Afterwards, the fate and transport of pathogens within the lake were simulated using a three-dimensional coupled hydrodynamic and microbiological model. This approach provided information on the contribution from different contamination sources to the pathogen concentrations at the water intake of a drinking water treatment plant. This approach addresses the limitations of monitoring and provides data for quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) and risk management in the context of faecal contamination of surface drinking water sources.}},

Campylobacter was quantified using the most probable number (MPN) method. The results showed that an increase in water temperature accelerates Campylobacter inactivation, measured as the loss of culturability. Insitu experiments revealed that inactivation rates were also affected by sunlight, but not by pH, oxygen concentration or water conductivity. These observations are supported by the seasonality detected in Llobregat River. Campylobacter inactivation was fastest in spring and summer, when temperature and solar radiation were at their highest. The results highlight the importance of considering the inactivation rates in natural conditions to improve the monitoring of this pathogen and thus evaluate properly the health risk associated to water.}},

For the method to be used quantitatively across environments, persistence and decay of markers must be understood. We measured concentrations of contaminant molecular markers targeting Enterococcus and Bacteroides spp. in marine and freshwater microcosms spiked with human sewage and exposed to either sunlight or dark treatments. We used Bayesian statistics with a delayed Chick–Watson model to estimate kinetic parameters for target decay. DNA- and RNA-based targets decayed at approximately the same rate. Molecular markers persisted (could be detected) longer in marine water. Sunlight increased the decay rates of cultured indicators more than those of molecular markers; sunlight also limited persistence of molecular markers. Within each treatment, Bacteroides markers had similar decay profiles, but some Bacteroides markers significantly differed in decay rates. The role of extracellular DNA in persistence appeared unimportant in the microcosms. Because conditions were controlled, microcosms allowed the effects of specific environmental variables on marker persistence and decay to be measured. While marker decay profiles in more complex environments would be expected to vary from those observed here, the differences we measured suggest that water matrix is an important factor affecting quantitative source tracking and microbial risk assessment applications.}},

  abstract = {{Surface runoff from animal production facilities contains numerous microbial pathogens which pose a direct health hazard to both humans and animals. In order to preserve safe water resources and sustainable agriculture by reducing runoff-mediated contamination of agricultural watersheds, microbial transport processes need to be properly understood and quantified. Cryptosporidium parvum is a protozoan parasite responsible for the largest outbreak of waterborne disease ever recorded in US history. Infected mammals can pass as many as 10 billion Cryptosporidium oocysts per gram of faeces, hence only a few infected animals can potentially contaminate a large watershed. Little information is available on the environmental or physicochemical factors governing the transport of microbial pathogen in surface and near-surface runoff, in particular the zoonotic pathogen Cryptosporidium. The objective of this study is to develop a physically-based model for simulating transport of C. parvum oocysts in overland flow, and to compare the model results with experimental observations. Transport of oocysts in overland flow can be simulated mathematically by including terms for the concentration of the oocysts in the liquid phase (in suspension or free-floating) and the solid phase (adsorbed to the fine solid particles like clay and silt). Oocysts adsorption and decay processes are considered. These processes are solved using numerical techniques to predict spatial and temporal changes in oocyst concentrations in solid and liquid phases. The model results are also compared with experimental results to validate the model. The model output reproduced the recovery kinetics satisfactorily, but under-predicted the total recovery in a few cases when multiple peaks were observed during experiments. Similarly, the calibrated model produced a good agreement between observed and modeled total oocysts recovery. With future modification, this model may provide a promising tool for developing effective management practices for controlling microbial pathogens in surface runoff.}},

The kinetics of inactivation of murine norovirus 1 and human adenovirus 2 in natural and artificial seawater by free available chlorine was studied by quantifying genomic copies (GC) using quantitative PCR and infectious viral particles (PFU). Human JC polyomavirus Mad4 kinetics were evaluated by quantitative PCR. DNase or RNase were used to eliminate free genomes and assess potential viral infectivity when molecular detection was performed. At 30 min of assay, human adenovirus 2 showed 2.6- and 2.7-log10 GC reductions and a 2.3- and 2.4-log10 PFU reductions in natural and artificial seawater, respectively, and infectious viral particles were still observed at the end of the assay. When DNase was used prior to the nucleic acid extraction the kinetic of inactivation obtained by quantitative PCR was statistically equivalent to the one observed by infectivity assays. For murine norovirus 1, 2.5, and 3.5-log10 GC reductions were observed in natural and artificial seawater, respectively, while no viruses remained infectious after 30 min of contact with chlorine. Regarding JC polyomavirus Mad4, 1.5- and 1.1-log10 GC reductions were observed after 30 min of contact time. No infectivity assays were conducted for this virus.

A comparative microbial inactivation study was carried out in groundwater by seeding selected pathogens and indicators in laboratory microcosms and Teflon diffusion chambers (in situ) fitted with 0·010‐ and 0·025‐μm pore‐size membranes. The results have shown that there is a difference in the decay rates obtained from the laboratory microcosms and in situ diffusion chambers for several pathogens. The results suggest that the use of laboratory microcosms to determine pathogen decay during the Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) may lead to underestimation of decay of adenovirus and Cryptosporidium and subsequent inaccurate assessment of the required residence time in the aquifer for pathogens to be removed from the recharged water. The decay rate of two indicator bacteria, Salmonella enterica and adenovirus, was found to be significantly slower (t‐test, P < 0·05) in the in situ studies when 0·010‐μm pore‐size membranes were used. The assessment of potential clogging of the diffusion cell membranes showed no clogging of the membranes within the 50‐day duration of the study as very little difference in the diffusion rates between new and old membranes was observed. Laboratory microcosms‐based inactivation studies can significantly underestimate the survival potential of enteric viruses in the groundwater. Consequently, in situ studies should be carried out for accurate assessment of potential enteric virus survival in aquifers. Reliable assessment of potential public health risks from the presence of pathogens in groundwater is essential for proper management of the MAR schemes. The results of this study suggest that in situ assessment of pathogen survival potential in diffusion chambers provided more reliable data for pathogen risk assessment and subsequent risk mitigation plans for MAR schemes.}},

The data were analyzed to assess factors affecting correlations using a logistic regression model considering indicator classes, pathogen classes, water types, pathogen sources, sample size, the number of samples with pathogens, the detection method, year of publication and statistical methods. Although no single indicator was identified as the most correlated with pathogens, coliphages, F-specific coliphages, Clostridium perfringens, fecal streptococci and total coliforms were more likely than other indicators to be correlated with pathogens. The most important factors in determining correlations between indicator–pathogen pairs were the sample size and the number of samples positive for pathogens. Pathogen sources, detection methods and other variables have little influence on correlations between indicators and pathogens. Results suggest that much of the controversy with regards to indicator and pathogen correlations is the result of studies with insufficient data for assessing correlations.}},

The model uses parameter values mostly taken from previous work, and it accounts for properties of the flow through the bottom shear stress and properties of the sediment through the critical shear stresses for cohesive and non-cohesive sediment. Predictions were compared to resuspension rates inferred from a steady mass balance applied to measurements at sixteen locations in a watershed. The model’s predictions matched the inferred rates well, especially when the diameter of particles to which E. coli attach was allowed to depend on the bottom shear stress. The model’s sensitivity to the parameters depends on the contributions of particle packing and binding effects of clay to the critical shear stress. For the current data set, the uncertainty in the predictions is controlled by the concentration of E. coli attached to sediment particles and the slope used to estimate the bottom shear stress.}},

Solar and heat treatments can inactivate rotavirus, but it is unknown how these treatments inactivate the virus on a molecular level. To answer this question, our approach was to correlate rotavirus inactivation with the inhibition of portions of the virus life cycle as a means to identify the mechanisms of solar or heat inactivation. Specifically, the integrity of the rotavirus NSP3 gene, virus-host cell interaction, and viral RNA synthesis were examined after heat (57°C) or solar treatment of rotavirus. Only the inhibition of viral RNA synthesis positively correlated with a loss of rotavirus infectivity; 57°C treatment of rotavirus resulted in a decrease of rotavirus RNA synthesis at the same rate as rotavirus infectivity. These data suggest that heat treatment neutralized rotaviruses primarily by targeting viral transcription functions. In contrast, when using solar disinfection, the decrease in RNA synthesis was responsible for approximately one-half of the decrease in infectivity, suggesting that other mechanisms, including posttranslational, contribute to inactivation. Nevertheless, both solar and heat inactivation of rotaviruses disrupted viral RNA synthesis as a mechanism for inactivation.}},

The main objective of this study was to develop an approach for quantifying the stability of a phytoplankton community using Lake Kinneret as a case study. It is a first attempt of calculating an index of stability for each of the five main taxonomic groups of the Kinneret phytoplankton (Bacillariophyta, Chlorophyta, Cryptophyta, Cyanophyta and Dinophyta), and for the entire community. A simple statistical approach to calculate the stability index was devised, using phytoplankton wet-weight biomass as the parameter being manipulated. The period 1970–1979 was selected as a reference period. The following stability indices were established and applied (each at three time scales): (1) a stability index for each of five main taxonomic groups; (2) a combined index of the stability, aggregating the stabilities of the individual taxonomic groups and (3) a stability index of entire community based on total phytoplankton biomass. The dynamics of these indices during 1969–2011 were examined. Destabilization of the community structure was triggered by an increase in the variability of Bacillariophyta biomass shortly after the reference period, in 1981–1983. Only 10 years later, the community destabilization become associated with progressively increasing biomass of Cyanobacteria. Dinophyta were the last to destabilize in the mid 1990s. Despite notable changes in the community structure, the total phytoplankton biomass remained relatively stable. Therefore, in 1969–2011 the stability index based on total phytoplankton biomass was higher than the combined index based on the stabilities of the individual taxonomic groups. Only weak relationships were found between the stability index values and potential driving forces (lake water level fluctuations and nutrient loads). While this approach was applied to Lake Kinneret, the concept presented is not lake specific and could be applied to other lakes.}},

The main source of zoonotic Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts in human drinking water is likely to be from farm animals via catchment pathways with water as the main transport vector. The vast majority of small agricultural catchments are ungauged therefore it is difficult to use a process model to predict and understand the mechanisms and activities that regulate the risk of surface water contamination from agricultural areas. For this study, two ungauged agricultural catchments in Ireland were used to model Cryptosporidium oocyst transport using SWAT2005 on a daily basis with reference data from adjacent catchment gauging stations. The results indicated that SWAT2005 could simulate stream flow with good agreement between prediction and observation on a monthly basis (R2 from 0.94 to 0.83 and E (efficiency) from 0.92 to 0.66), but Cryptosporidium oocyst concentration results were less reliable (R2 from 0.20 to 0.37, P < 0.05; with poor E −0.37 to −2.57). A sensitivity analysis using independent parameter perturbation indicated that temperature was the most important parameter regulating oocyst transport in the study catchments and that the timing of manure application relative to the occurrence of water runoff event was critical. The results also showed that grazing management had little influence on predicted oocyst transport while fields fertilized with manure were the key critical source areas for microbial contaminations in the study catchments. It was concluded that the approach presented could be used to assist with understanding the epidemiology of waterborne cryptosporidiosis outbreaks and to improve catchment management for the safety of the general public health.}},

Polychromatic UVC light, in contrast, is a more effective means of disinfection, presumably due to the involvement of viral proteins in the inactivation mechanism. Solar disinfection of HAdV, finally, is only poorly understood. In this paper, the kinetics and mechanism of HAdV inactivation by UVC light and direct and indirect solar disinfection are elucidated. PCR and mass spectrometry were employed to quantify the extent of genome and protein degradation and to localize the affected regions in the HAdV proteins. For this purpose, we used for the first time an approach involving stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) of a human virus. Inactivation by UVC light and the full sunlight spectrum were found to efficiently inactivate HAdV, whereas UVA-visible light only caused inactivation in the presence of external sensitizers (indirect solar disinfection). Genome damage was significant for UVC but was less important for solar disinfection. In contrast, indirect solar disinfection exhibited extensive protein degradation. In particular, the fiber protein and the amino acids responsible for host binding within the fiber protein were shown to degrade. In addition, the central domain of the penton protein was damaged, which may inhibit interactions with the fiber protein and lead to a disruption of the initial stages of infection. Damage to the hexon protein, however, appeared to affect only regions not directly involved in the infectious cycle.}},

The resulting model (SLIM-EC2) presents two specific and new features compared to the older SLIM-EC model version. The first is that the E. coli concentrations in the river are split in three fractions: the free E. coli in the water column, the ones attached to suspended solids and those present in the bottom sediments, each with their own transport, decay and settling–resuspension dynamics. The bacteria attached to particles can settle and survive on the bottom, where they can be brought back in the water column during resuspension events. The second new feature of the model is that it is coupled to the catchment model SENEQUE-EC, which thus provides upstream boundary conditions to SLIM-EC2. The result is an integrated and multi-scale model of the whole Scheldt drainage network from its source down to the Belgian/Dutch coastal zone. This new model reproduces the long-term median E. coli concentration along the Scheldt River and Estuary. An extensive sensitivity study is performed demonstrating the relative robustness of the model with respect to the chosen parameterisations. In addition to reproducing the observed E. coli concentrations in 2007–2008 at various stations, two extreme wastewater management scenarios were considered. Overall, there is no doubt that the Scheldt Estuary acts as a cleaning filter of faecal contamination originating from large Belgian cities. As a result, at the mouth of the Scheldt Estuary E. coli concentration is negligible in all investigated conditions.}},

Specifically, the removal pattern of FIB from the water column was examined as well as deposition onto the flume bed. Finally, the impact that a sudden increase in bed shear stress has on FIB in the water column was investigated. The large-scale flumes utilized in this study proved extremely useful for our investigations as they very closely approximated conditions within the Isar River (Munich, Germany). By using both natural substratum and fresh river water, as well as a flow velocity of nearly 1 m s−1 at a water depth of roughly 0.5 m, shear stresses typical of the Isar River (9 N m−2) were achieved. As a result, scaling effects were appreciably reduced. In our flume system, UV inactivation played only a minimal role in overall FIB removal. Therefore, we were able to more precisely investigate other mechanisms which result in FIB removal from the water column. From the two standard FIB removal experiments following a CSO, the removal rate coefficient (k) of 0.2 h−1 was identified for both E. coli and enterococci in the water column. An increase in the bed shear stress led to more than a 150\% rise in total suspended solid (TSS) levels in the water column. These elevated TSS levels (≈50 mg l−1) increased the persistence of suspended FIB in the water column by 20 h (k = 0.05 h−1). This indicates that higher TSS loads resulting from resuspended bed sediments can significantly expand the area that is impacted by a CSO event. At lower TSS loads (<20 mg l−1) deposition onto the flume bed did not contribute significantly to FIB removal from the water column. Any deposition which did occur did not result in a net accumulation of culturable FIB in the benthic biofilm.}},

  abstract = {{Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts have been known to cause adverse health effects worldwide, and processes that contribute to their inactivation have gained wide attention in recent years. Solar inactivation is an important process that can improve surface water quality. Solar disinfection (SODIS) can be used to disinfect water as a point-of-use alternative, and disinfect wastewater in waste stabilization ponds. However, a clear understanding of the oocyst solar inactivation mechanisms is lacking. This study systematically investigated the oocyst solar inactivation mechanisms in the presence of a wide range of environmental factors and also provided an insight on the metabolic response of oocysts using the microarray analysis. The result revealed that oocyst inactivation by solar UVA/visible light was dominated by UVA-induced internal radical damages and was sensitive to both the temperature and the oocyst source. External radical producing sensitizers did not enhance the UVA/visible light inactivation of oocysts due to the protection by the oocyst wall. In contrast, UVB was found to directly damage the oocyst genome, ensuring an effective inactivation that correlated only with UV fluence after being corrected for light screening regardless of the oocyst source, temperature, and the presence of external sensitizers. Further microarray analysis suggested that the effective UVB inactivation could be explained by the down-regulation of most of the genes responsible for cellular metabolic activities and the lack of expression of stress protection mechanisms in oocysts after 30 minutes of UVB exposure. These results facilitate the understanding and design of water and wastewater treatment processes that involve natural sunlight exposure.}},

For this purpose, the fate and transport of faecal indicator Escherichia coli within Lake Rådasjön were simulated by a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model. The calibrated hydrodynamic model described the measured data on vertical temperature distribution in the lake well (the Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.99). The data on the E. coli load from the identified contamination sources were gathered and the fate and transport of E. coli released from these sources within the lake were simulated using the developed hydrodynamic model, taking the decay of the E. coli into account. The obtained modelling results were compared to the observed E. coli concentrations at the water intake. The results illustrated that the sources that contributed the most to the faecal contamination at the water intake in Lake Rådasjön were the discharges from the on-site sewers and the main inflow to the lake – the river Mölndalsån. Based on the modelling results recommendations for water producers were formulated. The study demonstrated that this modelling approach is a useful tool for estimating the contribution from different sources to the faecal contamination at the water intake of a drinking water treatment plant and provided decision-support information for the reduction of risks posed to the drinking water source.}},

The objectives of the work presented in this paper were (i) to identify possible patterns in spatial and temporal variability of E. coli concentrations along the Yarra River, (ii) to understand the relationship between E. coli concentrations and other pollutants along the Yarra River, and (iii) to quantify the importance of stormwater drains in determining the magnitude of E. coli levels in the estuary. Two long-term water quality data sets, including E. coli concentrations, along the estuary were analysed: one data set comprises approximately monthly data collected in the period 1994–2010 at six sites, and the other is composed by weekly samples in 12 sites collected in 2005–2010. Additionally, data from two major stormwater drains were analysed. Median values of E. coli concentrations were observed to increase further downstream with concentrations showing larger variability in the estuary. Inter-annual and seasonal patterns were evident in the upper catchment, although differences were sometimes not statistically significant; in the more urbanised part of the catchment, including the estuary, inter-annual and seasonal variations were no longer present. A multiple linear regression analysis showed that the E. coli concentrations along the river were positively correlated with phosphorus. Estimates of loads from the streams and some of the drains supplying the estuary suggest that stormwater drains might be a considerable source of E. coli contamination especially during wet-weather flow; however, the loads from the drains appear to be at least one order of magnitude lower than the inputs of E. coli from upstream of the estuary. This result suggests that mitigation efforts for the Yarra estuary may need to focus also on areas upstream, as well as those impervious areas contributing directly to the estuary.}},

However, the specific contribution of major effectors such as temperature and sunlight on the inactivation of waterborne viruses is not well characterized. In this study, the effect of temperature (7, 20, and 37 °C), UVB and UVA radiation on viral inactivation was evaluated in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), mineral water, wastewater, 1,000-fold diluted wastewater and seawater. The stability of human adenoviruses infectivity, known as human pathogens and indicators of fecal contamination, was monitored during 24 h, both in the dark and exposed to UV radiation by immunofluorescence assays. In the dark, no Human adenovirus (HAdV) inactivation was observed in PBS and mineral water at any of the temperatures studied, whereas at 37 °C in reactors with higher microbial concentration (wastewater, diluted wastewater, and seawater), decays between 2.5 and 5 log were recorded. UVB radiation showed a dramatic effect on HAdV inactivation and 6-log were achieved in all reactors by the end of the experiments. The effect of UVA showed to be dependent on the water matrix analyzed. At 20 °C, HAdV showed a 2-log decay in all reactors radiation while at 37 °C, results in wastewater, diluted wastewater, and seawater reactors were equivalent to those observed in the dark. These results suggest UVB radiation as the major environmental factor challenging viral inactivation, followed by biotic activity indirectly associated to higher temperatures and finally, by UVA radiation.}},

  abstract = {{Numerous studies have reported quantitative data on viruses in surface waters generated using different methodologies. In the current study, the impact of the use of either cell culture-based or molecular-based methods in quantitative microbial risk assessment was assessed. Previously and newly generated data on the presence of infectious human enteroviruses (HEV) and enterovirus and parechovirus RNA were used to estimate distributions of virus concentrations in surface waters. Because techniques for the detection of infectious human parechoviruses (HPeV) in surface waters were not available, a ‘Parallelogram Approach’ was used to estimate their concentrations based on the ratio infectious HEV/HEV RNA. The obtained virus concentrations were then used to estimate the probability of exposure for children during recreation in such virus contaminated surface waters.Human enterovirus cell culture/PCR ratios ranged from 2.3 × 10−3 to 0.28. This broad range of ratios indicates that care should be taken in assuming a fixed ratio for assessing the risk with PCR based virus concentrations.The probabilities of exposure to both enteroviruses and parechoviruses were calculated, using our Parallelogram Approach for the calculation of infectious parechoviruses. For both viruses it was observed that the detection method significantly influenced the probability of exposure. Based on the calculated culture data, PCR data, and the ingestion volume, it was estimated that the mean probabilities of exposure, of recreating children, to surface water containing viruses were 0.087 (infectious enteroviruses), 0.71 (enterovirus particles), 0.28 (parechovirus particles) and 0.025 (calculated infectious parechoviruses) per recreation event. The mean probabilities of exposure of children recreating in surface water from which drinking water is produced to infectious enteroviruses were estimated for nine locations and varied between 1.5 × 10−4 – 0.09 per recreation event.In this study, the use of the rotavirus dose response relationship as a surrogate was avoided. Instead, the probabilities of exposure were derived as a function of the distributions of the calculated doses. Our ‘Parallelogram Approach’ was used to estimate the unavailable infectious parechovirus concentrations using Monte Carlo simulations, and the exposure assessment carried out showed that virus concentrations present in surface waters could pose a health risk for children and other vulnerable populations.}},

This study investigated the comparative persistence of subgroups of F+ RNA phages in river water under different conditions. Results suggested that temperature and pH are the major factors affecting the persistence of F+ RNA phages in river water, and organic substances promote phage survival. The comparative persistence patterns of subgroups of F+ RNA phages varied and may bias extrapolation of their initial proportions in surface water. Thus, the characteristics of water should be taken into consideration and the results should be carefully interpreted when F+ RNA phages are used for microbial source tracking.}},

A significant positive correlation (p <0.0001) was found between chlorophyll a (Chl-a) and the CDOM absorption coefficient a(350), indicating that algae degradation was likely the primary source of CDOM in black waters. This is supported by our field results that Chl-a, a(350) and the spectral slope ratio (S R) were significantly higher in the black water samples than in the regular samples (p <0.001). Our incubation experiment further substantiated the primary significance of biological CDOM source where a(350) increased with decreasing Chl-a concentrations. After seven days’ incubation, a 72.2\% decrease and a 74.9\% increase were recorded for Chl-a and a(350), respectively, relative to the initial values. Parallel factor analysis identified five fluorescent components. The maximal fluorescence intensity (F max) of tryptophan-like C1 and microbial humic-like C3 of black water samples was significantly higher than in the regular water samples (p <0.0005). This is consistent with incubation experiment results showing a rapid increase in F max of the two components, emphasizing the priority of the in situ biological CDOM source in black water spots.}},

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's current water quality testing strategies, however, rely on water borne E. coli concentrations to assess stream E. coli levels and identify impaired waters. In this work, we conducted a scenario analysis using a range of flows, sediment/water bacteria fractions, and particle sizes to which E. coli attach to assess the impact of E. coli in streambed sediments on water column E. coli levels. We used simple sediment transport theory to calculate the potential total E. coli concentrations in a stream with and without the resuspension process. Results clearly indicate that inclusion of resuspending sediment attached E. coli is necessary for watershed assessments and data on sediment attached E. coli concentrations is much needed. When neglecting the streambed sediment E. coli concentrations, the model predicted average E. coli loads of 107 Colony Forming Units (CFU)/s; however, when streambed sediment E. coli concentrations were included in the model, the predictions ranged from 1010 to 1014 CFU/s. To evaluate the predictions, E. coli data in the streambed sediment and the water column were monitored in Squaw Creek, Iowa. Comparisons between measured and predicted E. coli loads yielded an R2-value of 0.85.}},

  abstract = {{ Wastewater treatment ponds (lagoons) are one of the most common types of technologies used for wastewater management worldwide, especially in small cities and towns. They are particularly well-suited for systems where the effluent is reused for irrigation. However, the efficiency of virus removal in wastewater treatment pond systems is not very well understood. The main objective of this paper is to critically review the major findings related to virus removal in wastewater treatment pond systems and to statistically analyze results reported in the literature from field studies on virus removal in these systems. A comprehensive analysis of virus removal reported in the literature from 71 different wastewater treatment pond systems reveals only a weak to moderate correlation of virus removal with theoretical hydraulic retention time. On average, one log10 reduction of viruses was achieved for every 14.5–20.9 days of retention, but the 95th percentile value of the data analyzed was 54 days. The mechanisms responsible for virus removal in wastewater treatment ponds were also reviewed. One recent finding is that sedimentation may not be a significant virus removal mechanism in some wastewater ponds. Recent research has also revealed that direct and indirect sunlight-mediated mechanisms are not only dependent on pond water chemistry and optics, but also on the characteristics of the virus and its genome. MS2 coliphage is considered to be the best surrogate for studying sunlight disinfection in ponds. The interaction of viruses with particles, with other microorganisms, and with macroinvertebrates in wastewater treatment ponds has not been extensively studied. It is also unclear whether virus internalization by higher trophic-level organisms has a protective or a detrimental effect on virus viability and transport in pond systems. Similarly, the impact of virus-particle associations on sunlight disinfection in ponds is not well understood. Future research should focus on the interactions of viruses with particles and with other organisms, as well as the development of a model for virus removal in pond systems that can be used for design purposes, and to inform future editions of the WHO Guidelines for Wastewater Use in Agriculture.}},

Coliform bacteria, Escherichia coli and coliphages are normally used as indicators of water quality.

Human enteric viruses can tolerate fluctuating environmental conditions and survive in the environment for long periods of time becoming causal agents of diarrhoeal diseases. Therefore, the potential of human pathogenic viruses as significant indicators of water quality is emerging. Human Adenoviruses and other viruses have been proposed as suitable indices for the effective identification of such organisms of human origin contaminating water systems. This article reports on the recent developments in the management of water quality specifically focusing on human enteric viruses as indicators.}},

This review encompasses an overview of viral inactivation and virus genome degradation data from published literature as well as a statistical analysis and the development of empirical formulae to predict virus inactivation. A total of 658 data (time to obtain a first log10 reduction) were collected from 76 published studies with 563 data on virus infectivity and 95 data on genome degradation. Linear model fitting was applied to analyse the effects of temperature, virus species, detection method (cell culture or molecular methods), matrix (simple or complex) and temperature category (<50 and ≥50°C). As expected, virus inactivation was found to be faster at temperatures ≥50°C than at temperatures <50°C, but there was also a significant temperature–matrix effect. Virus inactivation appeared to occur faster in complex than in simple matrices. In general, bacteriophages PRD1 and PhiX174 appeared to be highly persistent whatever the matrix or the temperature, which makes them useful indicators for virus inactivation studies. The virus genome was shown to be more resistant than infectious virus. Simple empirical formulas were developed that can be used to predict virus inactivation and genome degradation for untested temperatures, time points or even virus strains.}},
