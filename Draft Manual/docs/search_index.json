Other processes impacting the oxygen concentration include the breakdown of DOC by aerobic heterotrophic bacteria to CO2, whereby a stoichiometrically equivalent amount of oxygen is removed. Chemical oxidation, for example processes such as nitrification or sulfide oxidation, also consume oxygen dependent on the relevant stoichiometric factor. Photosynthetic oxygen production and respiratory oxygen consumption by pelagic phytoplankton is also included and is summed over the number of simulated phytoplankton groups. Seagrass interaction with the oxygen cycle is configurable within the model. 2.2 Equations: aed2_oxygen aed2_oxygen : oxygen solubility &amp; atmospheric exchange Atmospheric exchange is typically modelled based on Wanninkhof (1992) and the flux equation of Riley and Skirrow (1974) for the open water, and on Ho et al. (2011) for estuarine environments. \\[\\begin{equation} F_{O_2} = k_{O_2} \\left(C_{air} - C_{water}\\right) \\end{equation}\\] Where \\(k_{O_2} (ms^{-1})\\) is the oxygen transfer coefficient, \\(C_{water} (gm^{-3})\\) is the oxygen concentration in the surface waters near the interface and \\(C_{air} (gm^{-3})\\) is the concentration of oxygen in the air phase near the interface. A positive flux represents input of oxygen from the atmosphere to the water. \\(C_{air}\\) is dependent on temperature, \\(T\\), salinity, \\(S\\) and atmospheric pressure, \\(p\\), as given by: \\[\\begin{eqnarray} C_{air}\\left(T,S,p \\right) &amp;=&amp; 1.42763\\: f\\left(p\\right) \\exp \\left\\{ -173.4292+249.6339 \\left[\\frac{100}{\\theta_k}\\right] + 143.3483 \\ln \\left[ \\frac{\\theta_k}{100}\\right] \\right. \\nonumber \\\\ &amp;-&amp; \\left. 21.8492 \\left[\\frac{\\theta_k}{100}\\right] + S\\left(-0.033096 +0.014259 \\left[\\frac{\\theta_k}{100}\\right] -0.0017 \\left[\\frac{\\theta_k}{100}\\right]^2 \\right) \\right\\} \\end{eqnarray}\\] Where \\(\\theta_k\\) is temperature in degrees Kelvin, salinity is expressed as parts per thousand and atmospheric pressure is in kPa. The pressure correction function, \\(f(p)\\) varies between one and zero for the surface and high altitudes respectively: \\[\\begin{equation} f\\left(p\\right)=\\frac{p_H}{p_{SL}}\\left[1-\\frac{p_{vap}}{p_H}\\right]/\\left[1-\\frac{p_{vap}}{p_{SL}}\\right]. \\end{equation}\\] aed2_oxygen : sediment oxygen demand Modelling sediment oxygen demand can take a variety of forms.

Over the past decade several advances have been made for the simulating organism dynamics using coupled hydrodynamic-organism fate models. These have generally been used for simulating coliform bacteria (Hipsey et al., 2008), with applications also reported for Cryptosporidium (Hipsey et al., 2004) and viruses (Sokolova et al. 2012) . In general, these models simulate organism concentrations within water bodies by accounting for external loading, advection and mixing process that occur within the lake interior, organism inactivation and sedimentation. The purpose of this document is to firstly synthesize relevant information from empirical and prior modelling studies to justify the necessary model required for reservoir systems, and secondly to summarise the implementation of the pathogen module within the AED2 model framework. 12.2 Process Description 12.2.1 General Approach The general balance equation for organism transport and fate is summarized in Hipsey et al., (2008) as: \\[ \\begin{equation} \\frac{dC}{dt} = \\begin{split} -\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x_{j}}(CU_{j})+\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x_{j}}(\\kappa_{j}\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x_{j}}) +C_{in}-C_{out}+C_{r}(\\tau,SS_{SED},C_{SED}) +[k_{g}(T,S,DOC_{L})-k_{d}(T,S,pH)-k_{l} (I_{0},S,DO,pH)-k_{s}(T,S,SS)-k_{p}(T)]C \\end{split} \\tag{12.1} \\end{equation} \\] where \\(C\\) is the organic concentration (orgs m-3), \\(t\\) is time, \\(x_j\\) is the distance in the \\(j\\)-th dimension (m), \\(U_j\\) is the velocity in the \\(j\\)-th dimension (ms-1), is the eddy-diffusivity and \\(C_{in}\\) and \\(C_{out}\\) are the inflow and outflow fluxes respectively (orgs m-3s-1). This relates organism concentration through time to hydrodynamic characteristics within the lake (as captured by \\(U\\), \\(\\kappa\\) and \\(\\tau\\)), and the environmental conditions experienced that influence organism fate (including temperature, salinity, light intensity, dissolved organic carbon, oxygen and pH). This comprehensive description is usually simplified for specific applications, based on justification of the dominant processes present in any particular lake and available data for model setup and validation. Within the TUFLOWFV-AED2 model framework, the 1st three terms on the RHS are solved via the finite volume scalar transport routines with TUFLOW-FV and the fourth and fifth terms are simulated by the aed2_pathogens module of the AED2 aquatic ecological modelling library. For this application the growth and predation terms suggested by Hipsey et al. (2008) are not considered directly since the likelihood of growth is small (Sidhu and Toze 2012) and predation/grazing is factored into the die-off rate (described below). The remaining terms for simulation of organism resuspension and inactivation are described in detail next. 12.2.2 Natural Mortality Natural mortality, or the ‘dark-death rate’, \\(k_d\\), is an important process determining the net rate of die off of protozoan, viral and bacterial organisms and has been reported to vary for specific organisms due to changes in temperature, salinity and pH. The reported die off rates in the literature however are widely variable, with a synthesis of numerous studies from a range of water bodies presented in Hipsey et al., (2008). For freshwater reservoirs, changes in salinity and pH are unlikely to be a significant driver of organism viability relative to the range presented Hipsey et al., (2008) and therefore a simple constant die-off rate that depends on temperature is appropriate: \\[ k_{d}(T) = k_{d_{20}}\\vartheta _{M}^{T-20} \\] where \\(k_{d_{20}}\\) is the rate of mortality in the dark at 20C and in freshwater. Since the AED2 implementation of the model to be applied with NPD does not include protozoan grazing as a separate term (as in Eq 1), the grazing effect needs to be embodied within the \\(k_{d_{20}}\\) term. This effectively assumes a constant grazing pressure over time, and if chosen to be a low value this will essentially ensure conservative estimate of the die-off due to grazing. Empirical data from Wivenhoe dam shows the presence of native micro-organisms can increase the background die-off rate by 1.1-3.0x (eg Table 5 in Sidhu and Toze (2012)). 12.2.3 Sunlight Inactivation Depending on the clarity of the water, the light climate of the lake can be a dominant factor influencing organism viability and this has been observed empirically in Wivenhoe Dam by Sidhu and Toze (2012). Different organism types experience different sensitivity to different light bandwidths, with most organisms sensitive to UV-B and UV-A and some sensitive to light in the visible spectrum (Sinton, Hall, and Braithwaite 2007). Hipsey et al. (2008) formulated a multiple band-width model for organisms that included direct and indirect mechanisms for sunlight mediated inactivation by accounting for the effect of salinity, oxygen and pH on free radical formation. Here we use a simplified form that accounts only for direct sunlight denaturation as the indirect mechanism is more specific to MS2 phage relative to rotavirus for example (Verbyla and Mihelcic 2015). The implemented expression is therefore: \\[ k_{l} = \\sum_{b=1}^{N_{b}}[\\varphi k_{b} I_{b}] \\] where \\(N_B\\) is the number of discrete solar bandwidths to be modeled, \\(b\\) is the bandwidth class {1, 2, … , \\(N_B\\)}, \\(k_b\\) is the freshwater inactivation rate coefficient for exposure to the \\(b^{th}\\) class (m2 MJ-1), \\(I_b\\) is the intensity of the \\(b^{th}\\) bandwidth class (Wm-2), \\(\\varphi\\) is a constant to convert units from seconds to days and J to MJ (= 8.64*10-2). In AED2, the light intensity is computed for 3 distinct bandwidths, including UV-B, UV-A and PAR, and the attenuation of each through the reservoir water column is based on bandwidth specific light extinction coefficients, that account for the effect of turbidity and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) on attenutation. 12.2.4 Sedimentation Sedimentation of organisms occurs at a rate depending on the degree to which the population is attached to suspended particles. Within AED2, this is captured by simulating free and attached organisms and multiple groups of particles may be accounted for. If we assume a single dominant particle size and ignore the effect of salinity on the settling velocity, then the expression in Hipsey et al (2008) for the effective sedimentation velocity reduces to: \\[ k_{s}=(1-f_{a})\\frac{V_{c}}{\\Delta z}+f_{a}\\frac{V_{s}}{\\Delta z} \\] where \\(f_a\\) is the attached fraction, and \\(V\\) is the vertical velocity of organisms or sediment particles. 12.2.5 Resupension Resuspension of organisms accumulated within the sediment has been show to be a relatively important terms in environments where high currents or waves exist. In reservoirs this can occur in the lake margins or deeper in the lake where internal waves or river underflows increase the shear stress at the sediment. The amount of organisms that resuspend depends not only on the shear stress but also n the concentration of organisms in the surficial layers of the sediment. This may be modelled by accounting for the deposited organisms, decay within the sediment and resuspension rate, however, this is notoriously difficult given potentially complex dynamics of organisms in the sediment. Instead we assume that a standard background concentration exists within different sediment regions (based on depth and local geomorphology) and simulate resuspension rate as: \\[ C_{r}(\\tau)=\\alpha_{c}\\frac{(\\tau - \\tau_{c_{s}})}{\\tau _{ref}}\\frac{1}{\\Delta z_{bot}} \\] where, \\(\\alpha_C\\) is the rate of organism suspension (orgs m-2s-1), which occurs when the critical shear stress is exceeded in the relative computational cell. 12.3 Parameter Summary 12.4 Setup &amp; Configuration 12.5 References Sidhu, J.P.S., and S.
