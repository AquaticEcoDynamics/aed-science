Other processes impacting the oxygen concentration include the breakdown of DOC by aerobic heterotrophic bacteria to CO2, whereby a stoichiometrically equivalent amount of oxygen is removed. Chemical oxidation, for example processes such as nitrification or sulfide oxidation, also consume oxygen dependent on the relevant stoichiometric factor. Photosynthetic oxygen production and respiratory oxygen consumption by pelagic phytoplankton is also included and is summed over the number of simulated phytoplankton groups. Seagrass interaction with the oxygen cycle is configurable within the model. 7.3 Model Description 7.3.1 Process Descriptions Oxygen Solubility &amp; Atmospheric Exchange Atmospheric exchange is typically modelled based on Wanninkhof (1992) and the flux equation of Riley and Skirrow (1974) for the open water, and on Ho et al.

Over the past decade several advances have been made for the simulating organism dynamics using coupled hydrodynamic-organism fate models. These have generally been used for simulating coliform bacteria (Hipsey, Antenucci, and Brookes 2008), with applications also reported for Cryptosporidium (Hipsey et al. 2004) and viruses (Sokolova et al. 2012) . In general, these models simulate organism concentrations within water bodies by accounting for external loading, advection and mixing process that occur within the lake interior, organism inactivation and sedimentation. The purpose of this document is to firstly synthesize relevant information from empirical and prior modelling studies to justify the necessary model required for reservoir systems, and secondly to summarise the implementation of the pathogen module within the AED2 model framework. 17.3 Model Description 17.3.1 Process Descriptions General Approach The general balance equation for organism transport and fate is summarized in Hipsey, Antenucci, and Brookes (2008) as: \\[ \\begin{equation} \\frac{dC}{dt} = -\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x_{j}}(CU_{j})+\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x_{j}}(\\kappa_{j}\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x_{j}}) +C_{in}-C_{out}+C_{r}(\\tau,SS_{SED},C_{SED})\\\\ +[k_{g}(T,S,DOC_{L})-k_{d}(T,S,pH)-k_{l} (I_{0},S,DO,pH)-k_{s}(T,S,SS)-k_{p}(T)]C \\end{equation} \\] where \\(C\\) is the organic concentration (orgs m-3), \\(t\\) is time, \\(x_j\\) is the distance in the \\(j\\)-th dimension (m), \\(U_j\\) is the velocity in the \\(j\\)-th dimension (ms-1), is the eddy-diffusivity and \\(C_{in}\\) and \\(C_{out}\\) are the inflow and outflow fluxes respectively (orgs m-3s-1). This relates organism concentration through time to hydrodynamic characteristics within the lake (as captured by \\(U\\), \\(\\kappa\\) and \\(\\tau\\)), and the environmental conditions experienced that influence organism fate (including temperature, salinity, light intensity, dissolved organic carbon, oxygen and pH). This comprehensive description is usually simplified for specific applications, based on justification of the dominant processes present in any particular lake and available data for model setup and validation. Within the TUFLOWFV-AED2 model framework, the 1st three terms on the RHS are solved via the finite volume scalar transport routines with TUFLOW-FV and the fourth and fifth terms are simulated by the aed2_pathogens module of the AED2 aquatic ecological modelling library. For this application the growth and predation terms suggested by Hipsey, Antenucci, and Brookes (2008) are not considered directly since the likelihood of growth is small (Sidhu and Toze 2012) and predation/grazing is factored into the die-off rate (described below). The remaining terms for simulation of organism resuspension and inactivation are described in detail next. Natural Mortality Natural mortality, or the ‘dark-death rate’, \\(k_d\\), is an important process determining the net rate of die off of protozoan, viral and bacterial organisms and has been reported to vary for specific organisms due to changes in temperature, salinity and pH. The reported die off rates in the literature however are widely variable, with a synthesis of numerous studies from a range of water bodies presented in Hipsey, Antenucci, and Brookes (2008). For freshwater reservoirs, changes in salinity and pH are unlikely to be a significant driver of organism viability relative to the range presented Hipsey, Antenucci, and Brookes (2008) and therefore a simple constant die-off rate that depends on temperature is appropriate: \\[ k_{d}(T) = k_{d_{20}}\\vartheta _{M}^{T-20} \\] where \\(k_{d_{20}}\\) is the rate of mortality in the dark at 20C and in freshwater. Since the AED2 implementation of the model to be applied with NPD does not include protozoan grazing as a separate term (as in Eq 1), the grazing effect needs to be embodied within the \\(k_{d_{20}}\\) term. This effectively assumes a constant grazing pressure over time, and if chosen to be a low value this will essentially ensure conservative estimate of the die-off due to grazing. Empirical data from Wivenhoe dam shows the presence of native micro-organisms can increase the background die-off rate by 1.1-3.0x (eg Table 5 in Sidhu and Toze (2012)). Sunlight Inactivation Depending on the clarity of the water, the light climate of the lake can be a dominant factor influencing organism viability and this has been observed empirically in Wivenhoe Dam by Sidhu and Toze (2012). Different organism types experience different sensitivity to different light bandwidths, with most organisms sensitive to UV-B and UV-A and some sensitive to light in the visible spectrum (Sinton, Hall, and Braithwaite 2007). Hipsey, Antenucci, and Brookes (2008) formulated a multiple band-width model for organisms that included direct and indirect mechanisms for sunlight mediated inactivation by accounting for the effect of salinity, oxygen and pH on free radical formation. Here we use a simplified form that accounts only for direct sunlight denaturation as the indirect mechanism is more specific to MS2 phage relative to rotavirus for example (Verbyla and Mihelcic 2015). The implemented expression is therefore: \\[ k_{l} = \\sum_{b=1}^{N_{b}}[\\varphi k_{b} I_{b}] \\] where \\(N_B\\) is the number of discrete solar bandwidths to be modeled, \\(b\\) is the bandwidth class {1, 2, … , \\(N_B\\)}, \\(k_b\\) is the freshwater inactivation rate coefficient for exposure to the \\(b^{th}\\) class (m2 MJ-1), \\(I_b\\) is the intensity of the \\(b^{th}\\) bandwidth class (Wm-2), \\(\\varphi\\) is a constant to convert units from seconds to days and J to MJ (= 8.64*10-2). In AED2, the light intensity is computed for 3 distinct bandwidths, including UV-B, UV-A and PAR, and the attenuation of each through the reservoir water column is based on bandwidth specific light extinction coefficients, that account for the effect of turbidity and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) on attenutation. Sedimentation Sedimentation of organisms occurs at a rate depending on the degree to which the population is attached to suspended particles. Within AED2, this is captured by simulating free and attached organisms and multiple groups of particles may be accounted for. If we assume a single dominant particle size and ignore the effect of salinity on the settling velocity, then the expression in Hipsey, Antenucci, and Brookes (2008) for the effective sedimentation velocity reduces to: \\[ k_{s}=(1-f_{a})\\frac{V_{c}}{\\Delta z}+f_{a}\\frac{V_{s}}{\\Delta z} \\] where \\(f_a\\) is the attached fraction, and \\(V\\) is the vertical velocity of organisms or sediment particles. Resupension Resuspension of organisms accumulated within the sediment has been show to be a relatively important terms in environments where high currents or waves exist. In reservoirs this can occur in the lake margins or deeper in the lake where internal waves or river underflows increase the shear stress at the sediment. The amount of organisms that resuspend depends not only on the shear stress but also n the concentration of organisms in the surficial layers of the sediment. This may be modelled by accounting for the deposited organisms, decay within the sediment and resuspension rate, however, this is notoriously difficult given potentially complex dynamics of organisms in the sediment. Instead we assume that a standard background concentration exists within different sediment regions (based on depth and local geomorphology) and simulate resuspension rate as: \\[ C_{r}(\\tau)=\\alpha_{c}\\frac{(\\tau - \\tau_{c_{s}})}{\\tau _{ref}}\\frac{1}{\\Delta z_{bot}} \\] where, \\(\\alpha_C\\) is the rate of organism suspension (orgs m-2s-1), which occurs when the critical shear stress is exceeded in the relative computational cell. 17.3.2 Variable Summary 17.3.3 Parameter Summary 17.3.4 Optional Module Links 17.3.5 Feedbacks to the Host Model 17.4 Setup &amp; Configuration 17.5 Case Studies &amp; Examples 17.5.1 Case Study 17.5.2 Publications 17.6 References Hipsey, Matthew R, Jason P Antenucci, and Justin D Brookes. 2008. “A generic, process-based model of microbial pollution in aquatic systems: MICROBIAL POLLUTION IN AQUATIC SYSTEMS.” Water Resources Research 44 (7). https://doi.org/10.1029/2007wr006395.

The model is originally based on an application to Oneida Lake and Lake Erie for mussels. One to several size classes of mussels are simulated based on physiological parameters assembled by Schneider et al. (1992) and modified by Bierman et al. (2005) to estimate effect of mussels on Saginaw Bay, Michigan, USA; a formulation also used by Gudimov et al. (2015) to estimate mussel effects in Lake Simcoe, Ontario, Canada. Additionally, some model structure was taken from the Spillman et al. (2008) model of Tapes clams in the Barbamarco Lagoon, Italy, as modified by Bocaniov et al. (2013) for mussels in Lake Erie. The physiology of mussels are set to be size dependent, and can vary between species (e.g., Zebra vs Quagga)(Hetherington, 2016). Three size classes of mussels can be incorporated in the model, roughly corresponding to age-0, age-1 and age&gt;1 mussels. Physiological parameters are calculated for the weight assigned to each age class, using equations in Table 4. Individual mussel mass is given in mmol C or in the case of calculations of N and P budgets, in mmol N and mmol P. The stoichiometric ratios (C:N:P) are fixed. Group mussel biomass is calculated at each time step by calculating ingestion and subtracting pseudofeces production, standard dynamic action, respiration, excretion, egestion and mortality (expressed in mmol C/mmol C/day, mmol N/mmol N/day; mmol P/mmol P/day). Several of these processes are also functions of temperature, algal+POC concentrations, salinity, suspended solids and mussel density. The effect of salinity, suspended solids and mussel density is incorporated as a multiplier of filtration rate with the multipliers having values between -0 – (no filtering) and 1 (no effect). Mussel nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations are fixed ratios of mussel carbon concentrations. Since the various input and output fluxes have variable C:N:P ratios, the excretion of nutrients is dynamically adjusted each time-step to maintain this ratio at each time step. Reproduction and larval dynamics are not simulated. There is no transfer of biomass between age groups. 23.3 Model Description 23.3.1 Process Descriptions Ingestion Ingestion is modelled as a function of filtration rate, food availability, pseudofeces production, density, suspended solids, and salinity (Equation 2) (Schneider 1992; Bierman et al. 2005; Spillman et al. 2008; Gudimov et al. 2015). Filtration rate is based on maximum ingestion, temperature, food availability, and pseudofeces production according to the following: \\(FR = \\frac{\\frac{I_{max}*f(T)_{I}}{K_{A}}}{PF_{min}}\\) for \\([A] &lt; KA\\) \\(FR = \\frac{\\frac{I_{max}*f(T)_{I}}{[A]}}{PF_{min}}\\) for \\([A] &gt; KA\\) where \\(FR\\) is filtration rate (mmol/mmol/d), \\(Imax\\) is maximum ingestion rate (mmol/mmol/d), \\(f(T)_{I}\\) is filtration temperature function, \\(K_{A}\\) is optimum algal concentration (mmol/m3), \\([A]\\) is algal concentration + particulate organic carbon (POC) concentration (mmol/m3), and \\(PFmin\\) is minimum pseudofeces production (-). The maximum ingestion rate is based on weight from length according to the following: \\(I_{max} = (a_{I} * W^{bI})\\) \\(W = \\frac{0.071}{1000} * L^{2.8}\\) where \\(Imax\\) is maximum ingestion rate (mmol/mmol/d), \\(a_{I}\\) is maximum standard ingestion rate (mmol/mmol/d), \\(W\\) is weight (g), \\(bI\\) is exponent for weight effect on ingestion, \\(L\\) in length (mm) (Schneider et al. 1992; Bierman et al. 2005). The temperature dependence function (Thornton and Lessem 1978) was fit to zebra and quagga mussel data (Hetherington et al. Submitted) with optimal ingestion from 17°C to 20°C according to the following: \\(f(T)_{I} = 1\\) for \\(T_{min_{I}} &lt; T &lt; T_{max_{I}}\\) \\(f(T)_{I} = (2*\\frac{Tmin_{TI}}{Tmin_{I}} - \\frac{(Tmin_{TI})^2}{(Tmin_{I})^2}) / (2*\\frac{Tmin_{I}-minT_{I}}{Tmin_{I}}-\\frac{(Tmin_{I}-minT_{I})^2}{(Tmin_{I})^2})\\) for \\(minT_{I} &lt; T &lt; Tmin_{I}\\) \\(f(T)_{I} = -\\frac{(T^{2} + 2*Tmax_{I}*T–2*Tmax_{I}*maxT_{I} + maxT_{I}^{2})}{(Tmax_{I}-maxT_{I})^{2}}\\) for \\(Tmax_{I}&lt;T&lt;maxT_{I}\\) \\(f(T)_{I} = 0\\) for \\(T &gt; maxT_{I}\\) or \\(T &lt; minT_{I}\\) where \\(T\\) is temperature (°C), \\(minT_{I}\\) is lower temperature for no ingestion (°C), \\(Tmin_{I}\\) is lower temperature for optimum ingestion (°C), \\(Tmax_{I}\\) is upper temperature for optimum ingestion, \\(maxT_{I}\\) is upper temperature for no ingestion (°C). Filtration rate is related to food concentration (Walz 1978, Sprung and Rose 1988, Schneider 1992; Bierman et al. 2005). The filtration rate is maintained at a maximum value for all food values less than saturation food concentration. The filtration rate decreases as food concentrations increase above this value. Pseudofeces production is implicit as the difference between the mass filtered and consumed. According to Walz (1978), pseudofeces production (66%) was approximately double the ingestion rate (34%) at high food concentrations (Bierman et al. 2005). Mussel density limits ingestion above some maximum density according to the following: \\(f(D) = 1\\) for \\(D&lt;Dmax\\) \\(f(D) = \\frac{-(D^{2} + 2*Dmax*D – 2*Dmax*maxD + maxD^{2})}{(Dmax – maxD)^{2}}\\) for \\(D&gt;Dmax\\) \\(f(D) = 0\\) for \\(D&gt;maxD\\) where \\(D\\) is density (mmol/m2), \\(Dmax\\) is upper density for optimum ingestion (mmol/m2), and \\(maxD\\) is upper density for no ingestion (mmol/m2). An additional function to reduce ingestion is the suspended solids function which decreases ingestion with high inorganic loads according to the following: \\(f(SS) = 1\\) for \\(SS&lt;SSmax\\) \\(f(SS) = \\frac{-(SS^{2} + 2*SSmax*SS – 2*SSmax*maxSS + maxSS^{2})}{(SSmax – maxSS)^{2}}\\) for \\(SS&gt;SSmax\\) \\(f(SS) = 0\\) for \\(SS&gt;maxSS\\) where \\(SS\\) is suspended solids (mg/L), \\(SSmax\\) is upper suspended solids for optimum ingestion (mg/L), and \\(maxSS\\) is upper suspended solids for no ingestion (mg/L) (Spillman et al. 2008). Along with suspended solids, salinity limits ingestion according to the following: \\(f(S) = 1\\) for \\(Smin &lt; S &lt; Smax\\) \\(f(S) = \\frac{(2*(S-minS)/Smin)–(S-minS)^{2}/Smin^{2})}{(2*(Smin-minS)/Smin)–(Smin-minS)^{2}/Smin^{2})}\\) for \\(minS&lt; S &lt; Smin\\) \\(f(S) = \\frac{-(S^{2} + 2*Smax*S – 2*Smax*maxS + maxS^{2})}{(Smax-maxS)^{2}}\\) for \\(Smax&lt;S&lt;maxS\\) \\(f(S) = 0\\) for \\(S &gt; maxS\\) or \\(S &lt; minS\\) where \\(S\\) is salinity (psu), \\(minS\\) is lower salinity for no ingestion (psu), \\(Smin\\) is lower salinity for optimum ingestion (psu), \\(Smax\\) is upper salinity for optimum ingestion (psu), \\(maxS\\) is upper salinity for no ingestion (psu) (Spillman et al. 2008). Respiration Respiration is modelled as a base or standard respiration rate based on weight and temperature (Spillman et al. 2008). Respiration rate coefficient at 20°C is based on weight from length according to the following: \\(R_{20} = (a_{R} * W^{b}_{R})\\) \\(W = \\frac{0.071}{1000} * L^{2.8}\\) where \\(R_{20}\\) is respiration rate coefficient at 20°C (mmol/mmol/d), \\(a_{R}\\) is standard respiration rate (mmol/mmol/d), \\(W\\) is weight (g), \\(b_{R}\\) is exponent for weight effect of respiration, and \\(L\\) is length (mm) (Schneider 1992). The respiration rate coefficient is adjusted for temperature according to the following: \\(f(T)_{RSpillman} = \\Theta_{RSpillman}^{T-20}\\) where \\(f(T)_{RSpillman}\\) is respiration temperature function, \\(\\Theta_{RSpillman}\\) is temperature multiplier for bivalve respiration (-), and \\(T\\) is temperature (°C) (Spillman et al. 2008). Alternatively, respiration is modelled as a base or standard respiration rate based on weight and temperature in addition to the energetic cost of feeding. Respiration rate coefficient at 30°C is based on weight from length according to the following: \\(R_{30} = (a^{R} * W^{b}_{R})\\) \\(W = \\frac{0.071}{1000} * L^{2.8}\\) where \\(R_{30}\\) is respiration rate coefficient at 30°C (mmol/mmol/d), \\(a^{R}\\) is standard respiration rate (mmol/mmol/d), \\(W\\) is weight (g), \\(b_{R}\\) is exponent for weight effect of respiration, and \\(L\\) is length (mm) (Schneider 1992). The temperature function follows Schneider’s (1992) application of the model of Kitchell et al. (1977) to the data of Alexander and McMahon (2004) according to the following: \\(f(T)_{RSchneider} = V^{X} * e^{X * (1-V)}\\) \\(V = \\frac{Tmax_{R} – T}{Tmax_{R} – maxT_{R}}\\) \\(X = (\\frac{W*(1+\\sqrt{1 + (\\frac{40}{Y})})}{20})^2\\) \\(W = lnQ_{R}*(Tmax_{R} – maxT_{R})\\) \\(Y = lnQ_{R}*(Tmax_{R} – maxT_{R} + 2)\\) where \\(T\\) is temperature (°C), \\(Tmax_{R}\\) is upper temperature for optimum respiration (°C), \\(maxT_{R}\\) is upper temperature for no respiration (°C), and \\(Q_{R}\\) is respiration curve slope estimate (-). The maximum respiration occurs at 30°C with 43°C as the upper lethal temperature. The energetic cost of feeding or specific dynamic action is applied only to the portion of ingestion that is not egested (Schneider 1992; Bierman et al. 2005; Gudimov et al. 2015). Excretion Excretion is modelled as a constant fraction of assimilated food (Schneider 1992; Bierman et al. 2005; Gudimov et al. 2015). Excretion data for zebra and quagga mussels are limited; therefore, the excretion formulation for Mytilus edulis derived by Bayne and Newell (1983) was used (Schneider 1992; Bierman et al. 2005; Gudimov et al. 2015). Egestion Egestion is modeled as a function of ingestion (Schneider 1992; Bierman et al. 2005; Gudimov et al. 2015). The model follows the assumption that ingestion is directly proportional to the food content of the water for all food concentrations less than the maximum which can be ingested. For all food concentrations above this saturation value, ingestion remains constant at a maximum value (Imax) (Walz 1978). Mortality Mortality is a function of dissolved oxygen and predation (Equation 7). Mortality increases with low dissolved oxygen concentrations according to the following: \\(f(DO) = 1 + K_{BDO} * \\frac{K_{DO}}{K_{DO} + DO}\\) where \\(DO\\) is dissolved oxygen (mmol/m3), \\(K_{BDO}\\) is basal respiration rate (mmol/m3), and \\(K_{DO}\\) is half saturation constant for metabolic response to dissolved oxygen (mmol/m3) (Spillman et al. 2008). A mortality rate coefficient (\\(K_{MORT}\\)) further influences the dissolved oxygen function. Additionally, mortality from predation is a constant rate added to the effect from dissolved oxygen. 23.3.2 Variable Summary 23.3.3 Parameter Summary 23.3.4 Optional Module Links 23.3.5 Feedbacks to the Host Model 23.4 Setup &amp; Configuration 23.5 Case Studies &amp; Examples 23.5.1 Case Study 23.5.2 Publications 23.6 References Hipsey, Matthew R, Jason P Antenucci, and Justin D Brookes. 2008. “A generic, process-based model of microbial pollution in aquatic systems: MICROBIAL POLLUTION IN AQUATIC SYSTEMS.” Water Resources Research 44 (7). https://doi.org/10.1029/2007wr006395.
